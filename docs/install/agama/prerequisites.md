# Agama Lab

[Agama Lab](https://gluu.org/agama-lab/) is a platform to manage your Gluu license. This is where you may subscribe to Gluu Flex or obtain credentials for your enterprise license.

- To begin, please visit [Agama Lab](https://cloud.gluu.org/agama-lab)
- You may register via email or login via GitHub
    - If you want to author or test Agama projects, you will need to login via GitHub
- Once you have logged in, please navigate to `Market` > `SCAN` and subscribe to the free tier. SCAN is the API gateway Gluu uses to validate licenses. The free tier will give you 500 credits. As license calls do not cost credits, this will not cost you anything.

# Software Statement Assertions

In order to install Flex, you will need a Software Statement Assertion (SSA). An SSA is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) that is required by the Flex install script to validate your license.

## Obtaining an SSA

Gluu issues SSAs through the Agama Lab web interface. You can obtain an SSA for use with Flex by following these steps:

- Login to Agama Lab
- On the left navigation bar, select `Market`
- Navigate to the tab named `SSA`.
- Sign up for a free SCAN subscription, which will give you 500 SCAN credits. Flex does not cost any SCAN credits, so you will not be charged for SCAN.

- Click on `Create New SSA`
    - On `Software Name`, fill in a unique identifier for this SSA
    - `Description` is optional
    - Under `Software Roles`, tick `license`
    - Under `Expiration Date`, select an appropriate date. Your SSA will not be useable after that date.
    - Under `SSA Lifetime`, choose an appropriate lifetime for the Flex client. One month or longer is recommended.
    - Deselect `One time use` and `Rotate SSA`
    - Click `Create`

- Click on `Detail` of the newly issued SSA, then click on `Show JWT`

- You will be shown a long string of characters. Copy this and save it to a file.
- You may now use this file during Flex installation.

# License
Gluu Flex uses the SSA obtained in the above step to either request a 30 day trial license or verify presence of a license tied to your Agama Lab account. One account may request one trial license in its lifetime. To purchase a full license, please navigate to the `Flex` tab of the marketplace where you may purchase licenses for up to 1600 MAU (monthly active users). To purchase an enterprise license for more MAU, please contact [Sales](mailto:sales@gluu.org).

If you have subscribed to Flex via Agama Lab, the SSA obtained in the step before will automatically link your license to your installation. For enterprise licenses, please open a support ticket so that we can issue a license against your Agama account. Once this is done, you may use the SSA obtained to proceed to installation.
