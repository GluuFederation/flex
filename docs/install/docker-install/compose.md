## How to run

Download the compose file of your chosen persistence from mysql or postgres

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/flex/main/docker-flex-monolith/flex-mysql-compose.yml 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/flex/main/docker-flex-monolith/flex-postgres-compose.yml 
```

Download the script files 

```bash

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/flex/main/docker-flex-monolith/up.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/flex/main/docker-flex-monolith/down.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GluuFederation/flex/main/docker-flex-monolith/clean.sh
```

Give execute permission to the scripts
`chmod u+x up.sh down.sh clean.sh`

This docker compose file runs two containers, the flex monolith container and mysql container.

To start the containers.

```bash
./up.sh #You can pass mysql|postgres as an argument to the script. If you don't pass any, it will default to mysql.
```

To view the containers running

```bash

docker compose -f flex-mysql-compose.yml ps
```

To stop the containers.

```bash
./down.sh #You can pass mysql|postgres as an argument to the script. If you don't pass any, it will default to mysql.
```

## Configure Gluu flex

1. Access the Docker container shell using:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f flex-mysql-compose.yml exec flex /bin/bash #This opens a bash terminal in the running container
    ```

2. You can grab `client_id` and `client_pw`(secret), and other values from `setup.properties` or `/opt/jans/jans-setup/setup.properties.last`

3. Use the CLI tools located under `/opt/jans/jans-cli/` to configure Gluu flex as needed. For example you can run the [TUI](https://docs.jans.io/head/admin/config-guide/config-tools/jans-tui/):
    ```bash
    python3 /opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli-tui.py
    ```

## Access endpoints externally

Add to your `/etc/hosts` file the ip domain record which should be the ip of the instance docker is installed at and the domain used in the env above `CN_HOSTNAME`.

```bash
# For-example
172.22.0.3      demoexample.gluu.org
```

After adding the record you can hit endpoints such as https://demoexample.gluu.org/.well-known/openid-configuration


## Clean up

Remove setup and volumes

```bash
./clean.sh #You can pass mysql|postgres as an argument to the script. If you don't pass any, it will default to mysql.
```
