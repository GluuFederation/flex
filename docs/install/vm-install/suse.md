# Install Gluu Flex On SUSE Linux

This is a step-by-step guide for installation and uninstallation
of Gluu Flex on SUSE Linux distributions

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the OS platform is one of the [supported versions](./vm-requirements.md#supported-versions)
- VM should meet [VM system requirements](./vm-requirements.md)
- Make sure that if `SELinux` is installed then
  [it is put into permissive mode](https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP1/html/SLES-all/cha-selinux.html#sec-selinux-mode-permissive)
- If the server firewall is running, make sure you allow `https`, which is
  needed for OpenID and FIDO.
```shell
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=https
```
```shell
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
- for SUSE Linux Enterprise(SLES) we need to enable PackageHub as per OS version and architecture
```
sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.4/x86_64
```
- Please obtain an [SSA](../../install/software-statements/ssa.md) to trial Flex, after which you are issued a JWT
  that you can use during installation. SSA should be stored in a text file on an accessible path.

## Install the Package

### Download and Verify the Release Package

- Download the release package from the GitHub FLEX [Releases](https://github.com/gluufederation/flex/releases)
```shell
wget https://github.com/GluuFederation/flex/releases/download/vreplace-flex-version/flex-replace-flex-version-stable-suse15.x86_64.rpm -P ~/
```

- GPG key is used to ensure the authenticity of the downloaded package during the installation process. If the key is
  not found, the [installation step](#install-the-release-package) would fail. Use the commands below to download and
  import the GPG key.
```shell
wget https://github.com/GluuFederation/flex/files/11814579/automation-flex-public-gpg.zip
```
```shell
unzip automation-flex-public-gpg.zip
```
```shell
sudo rpm -import automation-flex-public-gpg.asc
```

- Verify the integrity of the downloaded package using published `sha256sum`. Download the `sha256sum` file for the package
```
wget https://github.com/GluuFederation/flex/releases/download/vreplace-flex-version/flex-replace-flex-version-stable-suse15.x86_64.rpm.sha256sum  -P ~/
```

- Verify package integrity
```
sha256sum -c flex-replace-flex-version-suse15.x86_64.rpm.sha256sum
```
You should see:
```
flex-replace-flex-version-suse15.x86_64.rpm: ok
```

### Install the Release Package

Use SUSE `zypper` to install
```shell
sudo zypper install ~/flex-replace-flex-version-suse15.x86_64.rpm
```

### Run the setup script

- Run the setup script:

Execute the setup script with command below:
```shell
sudo python3 /opt/jans/jans-setup/flex/flex-linux-setup/flex_setup.py
```
If Admin-UI component is being installed, then the script will require SSA input, either as text or as a file path.
This should be the SSA or file which was acquired as part of [prerequisite step](#prerequisites).
```text
Install Admin UI [Y/n]: y
Please enter path of file containing SSA or paste SSA (q to exit):
```
Alternatively, for SSA file can be passed as a parameter to the setup script as below.
```shell
sudo python3 /opt/jans/jans-setup/flex/flex-linux-setup/flex_setup.py -admin-ui-ssa [filename]
```

## Verify and Access the Installation
Verify that installation has been successful and all installed components are accessible using the steps below:

- Log in to Text User Interface (TUI)
```shell
/opt/jans/jans-cli/jans_cli_tui.py
```
[TUI](https://docs.jans.io/stable/admin/config-guide/jans-tui) is a text-based configuration tool for Gluu Flex Server.

- Log into Admin-UI using URI below
```text
https://FQDN/admin
```

When troubleshooting issues with Admin UI access, it's advisable to check the [logs](../../admin/admin-ui/logs.md), refer to the [FAQ](../../admin/admin-ui/faq.md), and review [service dependencies](../../admin/admin-ui/introduction.md/#flex-services-dependencies) for potential solutions.

- Access Casa using URI below
```text
https://FQDN/jans-casa
```
## Enabling HTTPS 
To enable communication with Janssen Server over TLS (https) in a production 
environment, Janssen Server needs details about CA certificate. Update the 
HTTPS cofiguration file `https_jans.conf` as shown below:

!!! Note
    Want to use `Let's Encrypt` to get a certificate? Follow [this guide](../../../contribute/developer-faq.md#how-to-get-certificate-from-lets-encrypt).
- Open `_https_jans.conf` 
```bash
 sudo vi /etc/apache2/vhosts.d/_https_jans.conf
 ```
 - Update `SSLCertificateFile` and `SSLCertificateKeyFile` parameters values
 ```bash
SSLCertificateFile location_of_fullchain.pem
SSLCertificateKeyFile location_of_privkey.pem
```
- Restart `apache` service for changes to take effect
```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/rcapache2 restart
```
## Uninstallation
Removing Flex is a two step process:

- [Uninstall Gluu Flex](#uninstall-gluu-flex) and [Uninstall Janssen Packages](#uninstall-janssen-packages)
- [Remove Gluu Packages](#remove-gluu-flex-packages)

If you have not run the setup script, you can skip step 1 and just remove
the package.

First use the command below to uninstall the Gluu Flex server

```shell
sudo python3 /opt/jans/jans-setup/flex/flex-linux-setup/flex_setup.py --remove-flex
```
the output will be like this:
```text
sudo python3 /opt/jans/jans-setup/flex/flex-linux-setup/flex_setup.py --remove-flex

This process is irreversible.
Gluu Flex Components will be removed



Are you sure to uninstall Gluu Flex? [yes/N] yes
