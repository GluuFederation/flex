# Super Gluu Documentation

## Overview
Super Gluu is a free and secure two-factor authentication (2FA) mobile app. 

Super Gluu app can be used to achieve 2FA for web and mobile applications 
with [Janssen Server](https://docs.jans.io/), [Gluu Flex](https://docs.gluu.org/), and 
[Gluu Server](https://gluu.org/docs/) working as authentication servers.

Super Gluu documentation is organized into the following sections:

- [User Guide](./user-guide/index.md)
- [Admin Guide](./admin-guide/index.md)
- [Developer Guide](./developer-guide/index.md)

## Compatibility 

Super Gluu is compatible with all versions of Gluu Flex.

## FIDO Security
During Super Gluu authentication, the Gluu Flex does more than look at the device ID to grant access. Super Gluu uses 
the Gluu Flex Server's FIDO U2F endpoints to enroll a public key. The private key is stored on the device. At 
authentication time, the Gluu Flex sends a challenge response to the device to check for the corresponding private key. 
This adds an extra layer of security to Super Gluu push notification authentications. 

## How to Use Super Gluu 
Super Gluu is tightly bundled with Janssen. 
Follow the [Flex installation guide](./../install/helm-install/README.md) to 
deploy Gluu Flex, then follow the Super Gluu [admin guide](./admin-guide/index.md) to configure and begin using 
Super Gluu for strong authentication.

### Workflows
Super Gluu supports multiple workflows, including: 
- A one-step, passwordless authentication, where the person scans a QR code with their Super Gluu app, and the Gluu Flex
looks up which person is associated with that device.
- A two-step authentication, where the person enters their username and then receives an out-of-band push notification 
to the mobile device to authorize access (a.k.a identifier first authentication).
- A two-step authentication, where the person enters their username and password and then receives an out-of-band push 
notification to the mobile device to authorize access.   

In all scenarios, users are prompted to scan a QR code on their first Super Gluu authentication to bind their device 
and account. In the second and third workflows listed above, users begin receiving push notifications for all 
authentications after the initial device registration process. 

### Testing locally 

Super Gluu security is based on SSL, and therefore expects a public server with valid certificates. 
To test locally on a **non-public** server, [follow these steps](./developer-guide/index.md#testing-locally-)
