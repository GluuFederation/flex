# Overview 

Gluu Solo is a cloud-based identity management service designed to provide secure, scalable, 
and dedicated authentication solutions for businesses. It eliminates the need for complex 
infrastructure management by offering a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model tailored to various 
business requirements.

# Getting Started with Gluu Solo

To begin using Gluu Solo, you first need to create an account and log into Agama Lab, 
the platform that provides access to Solo's cloud-based identity services. Once logged in, 
navigate to the Solo tab to explore the available subscription plans and cloud locations 
that suit your business needs.

# Authentication

Gluu Solo enables secure authentication for your business identity requirements, 
leveraging millions or even billions of requests per month depending on your selected plan. 
Authentication is streamlined to ensure reliable access control and scalability, so you can 
manage your organizationâ€™s identity management seamlessly.


# Subscription

Gluu Solo offers various subscription plans tailored to different business needs. 
Each plan allows you to choose from multiple cloud locations and offers an SLA that 
aligns with your identity management requirements. Whether you're handling small-scale or 
large-scale requests, Solo ensures flexibility and scalability without the complexities of 
managing the infrastructure yourself.

The subscription pricing model is based on the number of requests made per month. 
This innovative approach provides cost benefits typical of a SaaS identity provider, 
while allowing you to select the level of redundancy and resource allocation that suits your organization. 
Solo does not use any shared resources; instead, it allocates dedicated resources in a closed, defined 
namespace that is exclusively owned by you.
