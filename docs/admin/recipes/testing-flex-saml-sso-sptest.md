## Configure IDP in Flex Server


In this tutorial, we will use [Iamshowcase](https://sptest.iamshowcase.com/) 
as the service provider. Follow the steps below to create a 
TR and apply them in [Flex Server](../../../../):

* Download the SP metadata using the following command:
```bash title="Command"
wget https://sptest.iamshowcase.com/testsp_metadata.xml
```
* Open the Flex Admin UI and navigate to `SAML > Configuration`.
* Select IDP to `Keycloak`.

* Finally, click Apply.

## Configure SP in Iamshowcase


After configuring the IDP in Flex Server, it's time to connect the service 
provider (SP) with the IDP:

* Download the IDP metadata from the following URL:
```
https://<your-janssen-server>/kc/realms/jans/protocol/saml/descriptor
```
* Go to: `https://sptest.iamshowcase.com/instructions#spinit` 
and upload the IDP metadata.
* After the metadata is uploaded, it will provide you with an 
SP link to test the SAML SSO flow.

## Test SSO

* Copy that link and open it in a browser. You can open it in 
incognito mode to avoid session issue.

* This will redirect you to the Janssen login page. Once you log in with 
your user credentials, you will be redirected back to the SPâ€™s protected page, 
which will display the user session details.
