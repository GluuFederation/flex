# SAML

## Description

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is a widely adopted protocol that enables Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities between an Identity Provider (IDP) and a Service Provider (SP). Gluu Flex supports SAML-based SSO by integrating with external SPs through the Keycloak (KC) module. Through the Admin UI, administrators can add and manage SAML Service Providers by importing their metadata and configuring which user attributes to release. The Admin UI provides a user-friendly interface to simplify the setup and testing of SAML SSO connections with external service providers like IAMShowcase.
