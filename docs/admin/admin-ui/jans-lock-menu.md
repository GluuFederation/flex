# Janssen Lock

[Janssen Lock](https://docs.jans.io/stable/janssen-server/lock/) (or just "Lock") provides a centralized control plane for domains to use [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en) to secure a network of distributed applications and audit the activity of both people and software.

Gluu Flex Admin UI enables administrators to manage Jans Lock settings, including logging configuration, metric reporter setup, and policy management, through a streamlined and user-friendly interface.
