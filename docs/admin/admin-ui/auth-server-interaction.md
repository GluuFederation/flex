# Interaction with Jans Auth Server

This user-friendly interface facilitates interaction with the [Jans Auth Server](https://docs.jans.io) through a REST API layer known as the [Jans Config API](https://docs.jans.io/v1.0.16/admin/config-guide/config-api). Here, we'll explore the working mechanism of the Gluu Flex Admin UI, focusing on its interaction with the Jans Auth Server and the key steps involved.

When accessing the Gluu Flex Admin UI through a web browser, the following steps are involved:

## License Verification

1. The user accesses the Gluu Flex Admin UI frontend through a web browser.
2. The frontend requests the Admin UI backend to retrieve Admin UI configuration from Janssen persistence. The [Admin UI configuration](./configuration.md) includes OIDC client details for accessing the Auth Server, OIDC client details for accessing the Token Server, OIDC client details for accessing the License APIs, and license metadata. It's important to note that **the Admin UI backend is implemented as a Jans Config API plugin**.
3. The frontend calls the Admin UI backend API (`/isConfigValid`) to validate the license configuration in persistence, essentially verifying the validity of the OIDC client used to access the License APIs. If it is not valid, the same API tries to register a new OIDC client using the SSA uploaded during installation. In case the SSA is invalid, the Admin UI shows a page to upload a new valid SSA.
4. After ensuring the validity of the OIDC client, the Admin UI calls the Admin UI backend API (/isActive) to check if a valid license is present in the license configuration. The Admin UI backend then calls the SCAN API (/scan/license/isActive) to verify the validity of the license.
5. If a valid license is not present, the frontend calls the backend API (/retrieve) to retrieve the license for the user via the SCAN API (/scan/license/retrieve). The license can only be retrieved from SCAN if the user has subscribed to the Admin UI license in Agama Lab.
6. If the user has not already subscribed to a valid license in Agama Lab, the Admin UI displays a page to generate a 30-day trial license. The user cannot generate another trial license after expiry of a generated trial license and will need to subscribe to the Admin UI license in Agama Lab to access the user interface.
7. After verification of valid license the frontend initiates the Authorization Code Flow by redirecting the user to the login page.

        Gluu Flex Admin UI->>Browser: Screen to generate Trial license
    end
end
Admin UI Backend->>Gluu Flex Admin UI: login page
```

## The Authorization Code Flow

1. The frontend initiates the Authorization Code Flow by calling authorization url and redirecting the user to the login page of the Janssen authorization server for user authentication.
2. Upon successful authentication, the authorization server sends an authorization `code` and a `state` to the frontend. The frontend verifies the state.
3. The frontend utilizes the authorization code to first obtain an access token (`AT1`) from the token endpoint of the authorization server.
4. With AT1, the frontend requests the User-Info in JWT format (`UJWT`) from the authorization server by calling userInfo endpoint.
7. The frontend stores the UJWT and its claims, including the user's role ( claim name is `jansAdminUIRole`) and other relevant information, in the Redux store.

```

## API Protection and Scopes

To ensure security and access control, Gluu Flex Admin UI leverages API protection and scopes:

1. The Jans Config API's endpoints are protected and can only be accessed using a token (`AT2`) with the required scopes.
2. To generate an AT2, the frontend requests the Token Server via the backend. **The Token Server and Authorization Server can be the same or different.**
3. The Token Server employs an introspection script that validates the UJWT and refers to the role-scope mapping in the Token Server persistence.
4. The introspection script validates the UJWT and includes the appropriate scopes in AT2 based on the user's role.
5. The frontend receives AT2 and associated scopes from the backend.
6. Features in the frontend are enabled or disabled based on the scopes provided in AT2. Refer this [doc](./admin-menu.md/#gui-access-control) for GUI access control.

Gluu Flex Admin UI->>Gluu Flex Admin UI:extracts scopes from AT2
Gluu Flex Admin UI->>Gluu Flex Admin UI: GUI access control based on scopes from AT2
```

## Accessing Config-API Endpoints

To access config-api endpoints, the following steps are taken:

1. The Admin UI frontend requests AT2 from the Token Server through the backend.
2. Armed with AT2, the frontend sends a request to the desired Jans Config API endpoint. AT2 is included in the authorization header, along with other request parameters.
3. At the Jans Config API, AT2 is validated, and the provided scopes are verified to ensure the necessary scope for the requested endpoint is present.
4. If the above steps are successful, the requested data is fetched from the Jans Config API and forwarded to the frontend.
