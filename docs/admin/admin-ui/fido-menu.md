# FIDO

## Configuring FIDO2

[FIDO 2.0](https://fidoalliance.org/) (FIDO2) is an open authentication standard that enables people to leverage common devices to authenticate to online services in both mobile and desktop environments.

FIDO2 comprises the W3C’s Web Authentication specification (WebAuthn) and FIDO’s corresponding Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP). WebAuthn defines a standard web API that can be built into browsers and related web platform infrastructure to enable online services to use FIDO Authentication. CTAP enables external devices such as mobile handsets or FIDO Security Keys to work with WebAuthn and serve as authenticators to desktop applications and web services.

Gluu Flex Admin UI allows configuring parameters of Janssen's FIDO2 server. Check following [documnetation](https://docs.jans.io/stable/janssen-server/fido/config/) for details of FIDO2 configuration parameters.
