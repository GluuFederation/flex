# SCIM Admin Guide

System for Cross-domain Identity Management, in short SCIM, is a specification that simplifies the exchange of user identity information across different domains. The Janssen Server provides an implementation for the [SCIM specification](https://docs.jans.io/stable/janssen-server/scim/).

Gluu Flex Admin UI allows administrators to view and manage the [configuration](https://docs.jans.io/stable/janssen-server/scim/config/) of the Janssen SCIM server.

## SCIM Use Cases

Some common use cases for SCIM in enterprise environments include:

- **User Provisioning**: Automatically creating and updating user accounts from identity sources like HR systems.
- **Group Synchronization**: Managing group memberships across services to control access.
- **Self-Service Portals**: Enabling users to update their own profile attributes.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration**: Aligning SCIM data with identity federation protocols.

To build a production-grade integration with SCIM, it's critical to understand both the specification (RFC 7642â€“7644) and Janssen's implementation specifics.
