# Gluu Flex Admin Guide

## Overview

Gluu Flex is a commercially supported distribution of the [Janssen Project](https://jans.io), including the OpenID, OAuth, Config, FIDO, and SCIM Server components. Additionally, Flex includes the commercially licensed Flex Admin UI and Casa, a self-service MFA platform.

## Janssen Documentation

Central to Gluu Flex is the [Janssen Project](https://docs.jans.io). Janssen enables organizations to build a scalable centralized authentication and authorization service using free open source software.

## Admin UI

The Gluu Flex Admin UI is a reactive web interface to simplify the management and configuration of your Auth Server. The Admin UI enables you to easily view and edit configuration properties, interception scripts, clients, and metrics in one place.

## Casa

[Gluu Casa](https://gluu.org/docs/casa) ("Casa") is a self-service web portal for end-users to manage authentication and authorization preferences for their account in Gluu Flex. 

For example, as people interact with an organization's digital services, they may need to:

- Enroll, delete and manage two-factor authentication (2FA) credentials for their account (e.g. FIDO security keys, mobile apps, phone numbers, etc.)
- Turn 2FA on and off
- View and manage which external apps have been authorized to access what personal data
- View trusted devices   

Casa provides a platform for people to perform these account security functions and more.
