# Gluu Casa

## Overview

Gluu Casa ("Casa") is a self-service web portal for end-users to manage authentication and authorization preferences for their account in Gluu Flex. 

For example, as people interact with an organization's digital services, they may need to:

- Enroll, delete and manage two-factor authentication (2FA) credentials for their account (e.g. FIDO security keys, mobile apps, phone numbers, etc.)
- Turn 2FA on and off
- View and manage which external apps have been authorized to access what personal data
- View trusted devices   

Casa provides a platform for people to perform these account security functions and more.
