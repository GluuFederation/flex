TLS Subject DN String representation of the expected subject distinguished name of the certificate, which the OAuth client will use in mutual TLS authentication. Is Expirable Client? Specifies whether client is expirable Client Scripts The custom scripts specific to the client. Scopes # The scope is a mechanism to limit an application's access to a user's account. An application can request one or more scopes, this information is then presented to the user in the consent screen, and the access token issued to the application will be limited to the scopes granted. For an OpenID Connect, the scope can be mapped with user claims. Spontaneous scopes # Spontaneous scopes are scopes with random part in it which are not known in advance. For e.g. transaction:4685456787, pis-552fds where 4685456787 or 552fds are generated part of the scope. Spontaneous scopes are disabled by default and can be enabled per client. The admins cannot create a spontaneous scope. Creation only happens when an authorized client presents a spontaneous scope at the token endpoint. There are the following client properties available during dynamic registration of the client related to spontaneous scopes: allowSpontaneousScopes OPTIONAL, boolean, false by default. Whether spontaneous scopes are allowed for the given client. spontaneousScopes OPTIONAL, array of strings. Regular expressions which should match to scope. If matched scope is allowed. Example: [\"^transaction:.+$\"]. It matches transaction:245 but not transaction:. UMA scopes # UMA scope can either be created by the user or auto-created by the auth server. UMA scope cannot be modified using Gluu Flex Admin UI. If the logged-in user creates UMA scope then the creator type will be USER and the creator Id will be logged-in user's INUM. If auth server has auto-created a UMA scope then it will have the creator type as AUTO and no creator Id. Dynamic Scopes # The dynamic scope custom script allows to generate a list of claims (and their values) on the fly, depending on circumstances like the id of the client requesting it, logged user's session parameters, values of other user's attributes, results of some calculations implementing specific business logic and/or requests to remote APIs or databases. Claims are then returned the usual way in response to a call to the user info endpoint. In order to configure a dynamic scope the following steps are required: The script of type DYNAMIC_SCOPE must be configured and enabled. Create scope of scope type Dynamic and select Dynamic scope script and claims inputs. Authn # Authentication Context Class Reference (ACR) enables applications to request and verify the level of authentication assurance or the context of the authentication process used for user authentication.

It is a downstream commercial distribution of the Linux Foundation Janssen Project software, plus two tools from Gluu: a web administration tool and a self-service web portal. SUSE Rancher\u2019s helm-based deployment approach simplifies the deployment and configuration of Flex, enabling organizations to take advantage of Flex\u2019s modular design to improve their security posture while simultaneously enabling just-in-time auto-scaling. The key services of Flex include: (REQUIRED) Jans Auth Server : This component is the OAuth Authorization Server, the OpenID Connect Provider, the UMA Authorization Server for person and software authentication. This service must be Internet-facing. (REQUIRED) Jans Config API : The API to configure the auth-server and other components is consolidated in this component. This service should not be Internet-facing. Gluu Admin UI : Web admin tool for ad-hoc configuration. Jans Fido : This component provides the server-side endpoints to enroll and validate devices that use FIDO. It provides both FIDO U2F (register, authenticate) and FIDO 2 (attestation, assertion) endpoints. This service must be Internet-facing. Jans SCIM : System for Cross-domain Identity Management ( SCIM ) is JSON/REST API to manage user data. Use it to add, edit and update user information. This service should not be Internet-facing. Gluu Casa : A self-service web portal for end-users to manage authentication and authorization preferences for their account in the Gluu Flex server. Typically, it enables people to manage their MFA credentials, like FIDO tokens and OTP authenticators. It's also extensible if your organization has any other self-service requirements. Building Blocks # Scope # In this Quickstart Guide, we will: Deploy Flex and add some users Enable two-factor authentication Protect content on an Apache web server with OpenID Connect. Audience # This document is intended for DevOps engineers, site reliability engineers (SREs), platform engineers, software engineers, and developers who are responsible for managing and running stateful workloads in Kubernetes clusters. Technical overview # In addition to the core services listed in the Introduction above, the SUSE Rancher deployment includes the following components: PostgreSQL/MySQL : SQL database dialect used to store configuration, people clients, sessions and other data needed for Gluu Flex operation. Cert Manager : Used for managing X.509 certificates and crypto keys lifecycle in Janssen Server. Key Rotation : A cronjob that implements Cert Manager to rotate the auth keys Configuration job : This job loads (generate/restore) and dumps (backup) the configuration and secrets. ConfigMap : Stores configuration about Flex environment setup. Secrets : Contains sensitive or confidential data such as a password, a token, or a key. Persistence job : This job loads initial data for LDAP or Couchbase. Config and Secret keys # The Configuration job creates a set of configurations and secrets used by all services in the Flex setup. To check the values of the configuration keys(configmaps) in the installation: kubectl get cm cn -o json -n <namespace> To check the values of the secret keys in installation: kubectl get secret cn -o json -n <namespace> Gluu Config Keys # Key Example Values admin_email support@gluu.org admin_inum d3afef58-c026-4514-9d4c-e0a3efb4c29d admin_ui_client_id 1901.a6575c1e-4688-4c11-8c95-d9e570b13ee8 auth_enc_keys RSA1_5 RSA-OAEP auth_key_rotated_at 1653517558 auth_legacyIdTokenClaims false auth_openidScopeBackwardCompatibility false auth_openid_jks_fn /etc/certs/auth-keys.jks auth_openid_jwks_fn /etc/certs/auth-keys.json casa_client_id 0008-db36db1f-025e-4164-aeed-f82df064eee8 auth_sig_keys RS256 RS384 RS512 ES256 ES384 ES512 PS384 PS512 city Austin country_code US default_openid_jks_dn_name CN=Janssen Auth CA Certificate fido2ConfigFolder /etc/jans/conf/fido2 hostname demoexample.gluu.org jca_client_id 1801.4df6c3ba-ebf6-4836-8fb5-6da927586f61 optional_scopes [\\\"casa\\\", \\\"sql\\\", \\\"fido2\\\", \\\"scim\\\"] orgName Gluu role_based_client_id 2000.9313cd4b-147c-4a67-96be-8a69ddbaf7e9 scim_client_id 1201.1cbcc731-3fca-4668-a480-1b5f5a7d6a53 state TX token_server_admin_ui_client_id 1901.57a858dc-69f3-4967-befe-e089fe376638 Gluu Secret Keys # Key Example Values admin_ui_client_encoded_pw QlBMMTZUZWVYeWczVlpNUk1XN0pzdzrg admin_ui_client_pw WnJYZEcyVlNBWG9d auth_jks_base64 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx auth_openid_jks_pass TWZoR3Rlb0NnUHEP auth_openid_key_base64 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx casa_client_encoded_pw b3NabG9oVGNncFVVWFpxNEJMU3V0dzrg casa_client_pw M1g0Z1dEbGNPQ19d encoded_admin_password e3NzaGF9eGpOaDRyblU3dzJZbmpPclovMUlheTdkR0RrOTdLe encoded_salt Um9NSEJnOU9IbTRvRkJHVVZETVZIeXEP jca_client_encoded_pw Um9NSEJnOU9IbTRvRkJHVVZETVZIeX58 jca_client_pw Um9NSEJnOU9IbTRvR otp_configuration xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx pairwiseCalculationKey ZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638ZHd2VW pairwiseCalculationSalt ZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638ZHd2VW0 plugins_admin_ui_properties xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx role_based_client_encoded_pw ZHd2VW01Y3VOUW66388PS512 role_based_client_pw AusZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638 scim_client_encoded_pw UZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638ZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638 scim_client_pw ZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638 sql_password ZHd2VW01Y3V638 ssl_ca_cert xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ssl_ca_key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ssl_cert xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ssl_csr xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ssl_key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx super_gluu_creds xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx3 token_server_admin_ui_client_encoded_pw Q1Z1cmtYWUlYSVg4U2tLTldVcnZVTUF token_server_admin_ui_client_pw ZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638 Prerequisites # SUSE Rancher installed with an accessible UI Kubernetes cluster running on SUSE Rancher with at least 1 worker node Sufficient RBAC permissions to deploy and manage applications in the cluster. LinuxIO kernel modules on the worker nodes Docker running locally (Linux preferred) Essential tools and CLI utilities installed on your local workstation and are available in your $PATH : curl , kubectl An entry in the /etc/hosts file of your local workstation to resolve the hostname of the Gluu Flex installation. This step is for testing purposes. Installation # Summary of steps : Install Database: Note For the Database test setup to work, a PV provisioner support must be present in the underlying infrastructure. Install PostgreSQL database: # Note If you are willing to use MySQL installation, skip this section and head to the Install MySQL section. To install a quick setup with PostgreSQL as the backend, you need to provide the connection parameters of a fresh setup. For a test setup, you can follow the below instructions: Apps --> Charts and search for Postgres . Click on Install on the right side of the window. Create a new namespace called postgres and hit Next . You should be on the Edit YAML page. Modify the below keys as desired. These values will be inputted in the installation of Gluu Flex Key auth.database auth.username auth.password Click Install at the bottom right of the page. Install MySQL database # Note Skip this section if you installed PostgreSQL . This section is only needed if you are willing to use MySQL. To install a quick setup with MySQL as the backend, you need to provide the connection parameters of a fresh setup. For a test setup, you can follow the below instructions: Open a kubectl shell from the top right navigation menu >_ . Run: helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm repo update kubectl create ns gluu #Create gluu namespace Pass in a custom password for the database. Here we used Test1234# . The admin user will be left as root . Notice we are installing in the gluu namespace. Run helm install my-release --set auth.rootPassword=Test1234#,auth.database=jans bitnami/mysql -n gluu Successful Installation # After the installation is successful, you should have a Statefulset active in the rancher UI as shown in the screenshot below. Install Nginx-Ingress , if you are not using Istio ingress helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable helm repo update helm install nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx To get the Loadbalancer IP: kubectl get svc nginx-ingress-nginx-controller --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}' Install Gluu Flex: Head to Apps --> Charts and search for Gluu Click on Install on the right side of the window. Change the namespace from default to gluu , then click on Next . Scroll through the sections to get familiar with the options. For minimal setup follow with the next instructions. Add License SSA . Before initiating the setup, please contact Gluu to obtain a valid license or trial license. Your organization needs to register with Gluu to trial Flex, after which you are issued a JWT placed here in which you can use to install. This must be base64 encoded. Click on the Persistence section. Change SQL database host uri to postgresql.postgres.svc.cluster.local in the case of PostgreSQL or my-release-mysql.gluu.svc.cluster.local in the case of MySQL . Also set SQL database username , SQL password , and SQL database name to the values you used during the database installation. To pass your FQDN or Domain that is intended to serve the Gluu Flex IDP, head to the Configuration section: Add your FQDN and check the box Is the FQDN globally resolvable . Click on the Edit YAML tab and add your FQDN to nginx-ingress.ingress.hosts and nginx-ingress.ingress.tls.hosts . Click on the section named NGINX and enable all the endpoints. You might add LB IP or address if you don't have FQDN for Gluu . To enable Casa and the Admin UI, navigate to the Optional Services section and check the Enable casa and boolean flag to enable admin UI boxes. You can also enable different services like Client API and Jackrabbit . Click on Install on the bottom right of the window. Note You can upgrade your installation after the deployment. To do that, go to the SUSE Rancher Dashboard -> Apps -> Installed Apps -> gluu -> Click on the 3 dots on the right -> Upgrade -> Make your changes -> Click Update. The running deployment and services of different Gluu Flex components like casa , admin-ui , scim , auth-server , etc can be viewed by navigating through the SUSE Rancher. Go to Workloads and see the running pods. Go under Service Discovery and checkout the Ingresses and Services . All deployed components should be in a healthy and running state like in the screenshot shown below. Connecting to the Setup # Note You can skip this section if you have a globally resolvable FQDN . In the event you used microk8s or your fqdn is not registered, the below steps will help with connecting to your setup. To access the setup from a browser or another VM, we need to change the ingress class annotation from kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx to kubernetes.io/ingress.class: public e.g., for the specific component you want to access publicly in the browser; Navigate through the SUSE Rancher UI to Service Discovery -> Ingresses Choose the ingress for the targeted component. For example gluu-nginx-ingress-auth-server for auth-server Click on the three dots in the top right corner Click on Edit Yaml On line 8, change the kubernetes.io/ingress.class annotation value from nginx to public Click Save The LoadBalancer IP needs to get mapped inside /etc/hosts with the domain chosen for gluu flex . If the domain you used in the setup is demoexample.gluu.org: 3.65.27.95 demoexample.gluu.org You can do the same edit for every each component you want to access publicly from the browser. Testing Configuration endpoints # Try accessing some Gluu Flex endpoints like https://demoexample.gluu.org/.well-known/openid-configuration in the browser and you'll get back a JSON response; Note that you can also access those endpoints via curl command, E.g. curl -k https://demoexample.gluu.org/.well-known/openid-configuration You should get a similar response like the one below; {\"version\":\"1.1\",\"issuer\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org\",\"attestation\":{\"base_path\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-fido2/restv1/attestation\",\"options_enpoint\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-fido2/restv1/attestation/options\",\"result_enpoint\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-fido2/restv1/attestation/result\"},\"assertion\":{\"base_path\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-fido2/restv1/assertion\",\"options_enpoint\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-fido2/restv1/assertion/options\",\"result_enpoint\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-fido2/restv1/assertion/result\"}} Testing Admin UI # Go to the browser and open https://demoexample.gluu.org/admin which should load the Admin UI license page. You would need to provide 4 keys to get access the Admin UI as shown in the screenshot below. Reach out to support management of Gluu on how to acquire the license keys which have an expiry date but can be renewed. API Key Product Code Shared Key Management Key Reach out if you need test-keys that you can test with. Login and Add a New User. # After inputting the license keys, you can then use admin and the password you set to login to the Admin UI and you should see the Admin UI dashboard. You could also add another test user via the admin UI that will be used for testing Casa and 2FA as shown in the screenshot below. Navigate to Users and click on + in the top right corner to add a user. Testing Casa # Gluu Casa (\"Casa\") is a self-service web portal for managing account security preferences. The primary use case for Casa is self-service 2FA, but other use cases and functionalities can be supported via Casa plugins. Although you have not enabled two-factor authentication yet, you should still be able to login to Casa as the admin user and the password is the one you set during installation. Point your browser to https://demoexample.gluu.org/casa and you should be welcomed by the Casa login page as shown below. After logging in, you'll be welcomed by the home page as shown below. Enabling Two Factor Authentication # In this part, we are going to enable two standard authentication mechanisms: OTP and FIDO. This can be done through the admin UI. 2FA can be turned on by clicking the switch in the Second Factor Authentication widget. By default, you will be able to choose from a few 2FA policies: Always (upon every login attempt) If the location (e.g. city) detected in the login attempt is unrecognized If the device used to login is unrecognized To reduce the chance of account lockout, enroll at least two different types of 2FA credentials -- e.g. one security key and one OTP app; or one OTP app and one SMS phone number, etc. This way, regardless of which device you're using to access a protected resource, you will have a usable option for passing strong authentication. To enable 2FA, firstly the OTP and FIDO components have to be enabled in the Casa admin UI then login to Casa as an end user, and register an OTP device (i.e. Google Authenticator) and a FIDO device. Register OTP device To add a new OTP token, navigate to 2FA credentials > OTP Tokens. You can either add a soft OTP token by choosing the Soft token option or a hard token by choosing the Hard Token Option Check the soft OTP token and click ready Before proceeding to the next step, Download Google Authenticator from Google Play or Appstore Then proceed and scan the QR code with your app Enter the 6-digit code that appears in your authenticator app and validate the enrollment. Register Fido device To add a new FIDO 2 credential, navigate to 2FA credentials > Security Keys and built-in Platform Authenticators Insert the fido key and click Ready. Casa will prompt you to press the button on the key. Add a nickname and click Add. Once added, the new device will appear in a list on the same page. Click the pencil to edit the device's nickname Testing Apache OIDC Locally # In this part, we are going to use docker to locally configure an apache web server, and then install the mod_auth_openidc module and configure it accordingly. Using local docker containers, our approach is to first register a client, then spin up two Apache containers, one serving static content (with server-side includes configured so we can display headers and environment information), and one acting as the OpenID Connect authenticating reverse proxy. Register an OpenID Connect client # On the Janssen server, you can register a new client in the Flex Admin UI or the jans-cli. In this section, we are going to show both ways of doing it from the Admin UI and using jans-cli Admin UI # Navigate to Auth server -> Clients and click on + in the top right corner to create a client. Take note of the following keys:values because they configure the right client that we need scopes: email_,openid_,profile responseTypes: code The screenshot below shows an example of the Admin UI section from where a client is created Jans TUI # On the Janssen server, we are going to register a new client using the jans-cli. There are two ways you can register an OIDC client with the Janssen server, Manual Client Registration and Dynamic Client Registration (DCR). Here we will use manual client registration. We will use jans-tui tool provided by the Janssen server. jans-tui has a menu-driven interface that makes it easy to configure the Janssen server. Here we will use the menu-driven approach to register a new client. Download or build config-cli-tui then: Get the role based client id and secret: # Notice the namespace is jans here . Change it if it was changed during installation of janssen previously ROLE_BASED_CLIENT_ID = $( kubectl get cm cn -o json -n jans | grep '\"role_based_client_id\":' | sed -e 's#.*:\\(\\)#\\1#' | tr -d '\"' | tr -d \",\" | tr -d '[:space:]' ) ROLE_BASED_CLIENT_SECRET = $( kubectl get secret cn -o json -n jans | grep '\"role_based_client_pw\":' | sed -e 's#.*:\\(\\)#\\1#' | tr -d '\"' | tr -d \",\" | tr -d '[:space:]' | base64 -d ) 2. Get schema file using this command `./config-cli-tui.pyz --host <FQDN> --client-id <ROLE_BASED_CLIENT_ID> --client-secret <ROLE_BASED_CLIENT_SECRET> --no-tui --schema /components/schemas/Client` Add values for required params and store this JSON in a text file. Take keynote of the following properties. schema-json-file.json { \"dn\": null, \"inum\": null, \"displayName\": \"<name-of-choice>\", \"clientSecret\": \"<secret-of-your-choice>\", \"frontChannelLogoutUri\": null, \"frontChannelLogoutSessionRequired\": null, \"registrationAccessToken\": null, \"clientIdIssuedAt\": null, \"clientSecretExpiresAt\": null, \"redirectUris\": [ \"<your-uri-here>\" ], \"claimRedirectUris\": null, \"responseTypes\": [ \"code\" ], \"grantTypes\": [ \"authorization_code\" ], \"applicationType\": \"web\", \"contacts\": null, \"idTokenTokenBindingCnf\": null, \"logoUri\": null, \"clientUri\": null, \"policyUri\": null, \"tosUri\": null, \"jwksUri\": null, \"jwks\": null, \"sectorIdentifierUri\": null, \"subjectType\": \"public\", \"idTokenSignedResponseAlg\": null, \"idTokenEncryptedResponseAlg\": null, \"idTokenEncryptedResponseEnc\": null, \"userInfoSignedResponseAlg\": null, \"userInfoEncryptedResponseAlg\": null, \"userInfoEncryptedResponseEnc\": null, \"requestObjectSigningAlg\": null, \"requestObjectEncryptionAlg\": null, \"requestObjectEncryptionEnc\": null, \"tokenEndpointAuthMethod\": \"client_secret_basic\", \"tokenEndpointAuthSigningAlg\": null, \"defaultMaxAge\": null, \"requireAuthTime\": null, \"defaultAcrValues\": null, \"initiateLoginUri\": null, \"postLogoutRedirectUris\": null, \"requestUris\": null, \"scopes\": [ \"email\", \"openid\", \"profile\" ], \"claims\": null, \"trustedClient\": false, \"lastAccessTime\": null, \"lastLogonTime\": null, \"persistClientAuthorizations\": null, \"includeClaimsInIdToken\": false, \"refreshTokenLifetime\": null, \"accessTokenLifetime\": null, \"customAttributes\": null, \"customObjectClasses\": null, \"rptAsJwt\": null, \"accessTokenAsJwt\": null, \"accessTokenSigningAlg\": null, \"disabled\": false, \"authorizedOrigins\": null, \"softwareId\": null, \"softwareVersion\": null, \"softwareStatement\": null, \"attributes\": null, \"backchannelTokenDeliveryMode\": null, \"backchannelClientNotificationEndpoint\": null, \"backchannelAuthenticationRequestSigningAlg\": null, \"backchannelUserCodeParameter\": null, \"expirationDate\": null, \"deletable\": false, \"jansId\": null, \"description\": null } Now you can use that JSON file as input to the command below and register your client ./config-cli-tui.pyz --host <FQDN> --client-id <ROLE_BASED_CLIENT_ID> --client-secret <ROLE_BASED_CLIENT_SECRET> --no-tui --operation-id=post-oauth-openid-client --data <path>/schema-json-file.json After the client is successfully registered, there will be data that describes the newly registered client. Some of these values, like inum and clientSecret , will be required before we configure mod_auth_openidc So keep in mind that we shall get back to this. Create an Application Container # An application docker container will be run locally which will act as the protected resource (PR) / external application. The following files have code for the small application. We shall create a directory locally / on your machine called test and add the required files. Firstly create a project folder named test by running mkdir test && cd test and add the following files with their content; app.conf ServerRoot \"/usr/local/apache2\" Listen 80 LoadModule mpm_event_module modules/mod_mpm_event.so LoadModule authz_core_module modules/mod_authz_core.so LoadModule include_module modules/mod_include.so LoadModule filter_module modules/mod_filter.so LoadModule mime_module modules/mod_mime.so LoadModule log_config_module modules/mod_log_config.so LoadModule setenvif_module modules/mod_setenvif.so LoadModule unixd_module modules/mod_unixd.so LoadModule dir_module modules/mod_dir.so User daemon Group daemon <Directory /> AllowOverride none Require all denied </Directory> DocumentRoot \"/usr/local/apache2/htdocs\" <Directory \"/usr/local/apache2/htdocs\"> Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes AllowOverride None Require all granted SetEnvIf X-Remote-User \"(.*)\" REMOTE_USER=$0 SetEnvIf X-Remote-User-Name \"(.*)\" REMOTE_USER_NAME=$0 SetEnvIf X-Remote-User-Email \"(.*)\" REMOTE_USER_EMAIL=$0 </Directory> DirectoryIndex index.html <Files \".ht*\"> Require all denied </Files> ErrorLog /proc/self/fd/2 LogLevel warn LogFormat \"%h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %b \\\"%{Referer}i\\\" \\\"%{User-Agent}i\\\"\" combined LogFormat \"%h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %b\" common CustomLog /proc/self/fd/1 common TypesConfig conf/mime.types AddType application/x-compress .Z AddType application/x-gzip .gz .tgz AddType text/html .shtml AddOutputFilter INCLUDES .shtml user.shtml <html> <head> <title>Hello User</title> </head> <body> <p>Hello <!--#echo var=REMOTE_USER_NAME -->!</p> <p>You authenticated as: <!--#echo var=REMOTE_USER --></p> <p>Your email address is: <!--#echo var=REMOTE_USER_EMAIL --></p> <p>Environment:</> <p><!--#printenv -->!</p> </body> </html> index.html <html> <head> <title>Hello World</title> </head> <body> <p>Hello world!</p> </body> </html> Dockerfile FROM httpd:2.4.54@sha256:c9eba4494b9d856843b49eb897f9a583a0873b1c14c86d5ab77e5bdedd6ad05d # \"Created\": \"2022-06-08T18:45:46.260791323Z\" , \"Version\":\"2.4.54\" RUN apt-get update \\ && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends wget ca-certificates libcjose0 libhiredis0.14 apache2-api-20120211 apache2-bin\\ && wget https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/releases/download/v2.4.11.2/libapache2-mod-auth-openidc_2.4.11.2-1.buster+1_amd64.deb \\ && dpkg -i libapache2-mod-auth-openidc_2.4.11.2-1.buster+1_amd64.deb \\ && ln -s /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_auth_openidc.so /usr/local/apache2/modules/mod_auth_openidc.so \\ && rm -rf /var/log/dpkg.log /var/log/alternatives.log /var/log/apt \\ && touch /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/secret.conf \\ && touch /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/oidc.conf RUN echo \"\\n\\nLoadModule auth_openidc_module modules/mod_auth_openidc.so\\n\\nInclude conf/extra/secret.conf\\nInclude conf/extra/oidc.conf\\n\" >> /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf gluu.secret.conf OIDCClientID <inum-as-received-in-client-registration-response> OIDCCryptoPassphrase <crypto-passphrase-of-choice> OIDCClientSecret <as-provided-in-client-registration-request> OIDCResponseType code OIDCScope \"openid email profile\" OIDCProviderTokenEndpointAuth client_secret_basic OIDCSSLValidateServer Off OIDCRedirectURI http://localhost:8111/oauth2callback OIDCCryptoPassphrase <crypto-passphrase-of-choice> <Location \"/\"> Require valid-user AuthType openid-connect </Location> After, run an Apache container which will play the role of an application being protected by the authenticating reverse proxy. docker run -dit -p 8110:80 \\ -v \"$PWD/app.conf\":/usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf \\ -v \"$PWD/index.html\":/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html \\ -v \"$PWD/user.shtml\":/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/user.shtml \\ --name apache-app httpd:2.4 Note that we are using a popular pre-built image useful for acting as a reverse proxy for authentication in front of an application.

It is a downstream commercial distribution of the Linux Foundation Janssen Project software, plus two tools from Gluu: a web administration tool and a self-service web portal. SUSE Rancher\u2019s helm-based deployment approach simplifies the deployment and configuration of Flex, enabling organizations to take advantage of Flex\u2019s modular design to improve their security posture while simultaneously enabling just-in-time auto-scaling. The key services of Flex include: (REQUIRED) Jans Auth Server : This component is the OAuth Authorization Server, the OpenID Connect Provider, the UMA Authorization Server for person and software authentication. This service must be Internet-facing. (REQUIRED) Jans Config API : The API to configure the auth-server and other components is consolidated in this component. This service should not be Internet-facing. Gluu Admin UI : Web admin tool for ad-hoc configuration. Jans Fido : This component provides the server-side endpoints to enroll and validate devices that use FIDO. It provides both FIDO U2F (register, authenticate) and FIDO 2 (attestation, assertion) endpoints. This service must be Internet-facing. Jans SCIM : System for Cross-domain Identity Management ( SCIM ) is JSON/REST API to manage user data. Use it to add, edit and update user information. This service should not be Internet-facing. Gluu Casa : A self-service web portal for end-users to manage authentication and authorization preferences for their account in the Gluu Flex server. Typically, it enables people to manage their MFA credentials, like FIDO tokens and OTP authenticators. It's also extensible if your organization has any other self-service requirements.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"admin/recipes/getting-started-rancher/#building-blocks","text":"","title":"Building Blocks"},{"location":"admin/recipes/getting-started-rancher/#scope","text":"In this Quickstart Guide, we will: Deploy Flex and add some users Enable two-factor authentication Protect content on an Apache web server with OpenID Connect.","title":"Scope"},{"location":"admin/recipes/getting-started-rancher/#audience","text":"This document is intended for DevOps engineers, site reliability engineers (SREs), platform engineers, software engineers, and developers who are responsible for managing and running stateful workloads in Kubernetes clusters.","title":"Audience"},{"location":"admin/recipes/getting-started-rancher/#technical-overview","text":"In addition to the core services listed in the Introduction above, the SUSE Rancher deployment includes the following components: PostgreSQL/MySQL : SQL database dialect used to store configuration, people clients, sessions and other data needed for Gluu Flex operation.

Credential Dashboard # The credential dashboard displays widgets for each type of supported 2FA credential (e.g. U2F keys, OTP apps, etc.). Each widget includes summary details of enrolled credentials and a button to add / change credentials. To manage existing credentials and enroll new credentials, click the Manage button: 2FA overview # Turn 2FA on/off # After the minimum number of credentials have been enrolled (as specified by the system admin), 2FA can be turned on by clicking the switch in the Second Factor Authentication widget: If the switch is not visible, your administrator may have configured the system so that 2FA is turned on automatically when enough credentials are available. When prompted for 2FA, a combination of credential strength and the type of device being used to access the protected resource will be used to determine which type of strong credential is prompted first. Depending on settings specified by your admin, you can actually choose the type of credential yourself. As an example, if you're accessing a 2FA protected application from a laptop, and you've enrolled FIDO keys and OTP apps to secure your account, FIDO will be presented as the first option for 2FA. Alternatively, if you're accessing the protected resource from a mobile device, OTP will be presented first. The exact ranking and order will be determined by the administrator. If at any time the credential prompted is unavailable, you can choose to present any other previously enrolled 2FA credential type.

For instance, security keys may not be compatible with mobile phones or certain browsers. To reduce the chance of account lockout , enroll at least two different types of 2FA credentials -- e.g. one security key and one OTP app; or one OTP app and one SMS phone number, etc. This way, regardless which device you're using to access a protected resource, you will have a usable option for passing strong authentication. 2FA credential details & enrollment # The details page provides additional details about each enrolled credential, for instance last used, mobile operating system, and device name.

If you want to apply more advanced customizations, adding the custom branding plugin is the way to go. Note This page covers customizations available through the custom branding plugin . It is assumed you have already added it to your Casa installation. The plugin allows administrators to easily alter the appearance of applications. There are two ways to tweak the design: a quick point-and-click set of changes that you can preview immediately, or a lower-level approach that allows you to supply your own CSS file and images (this is known as external assets directory usage). Quick design customization # Click on Custom branding in the admin console, and choose Upload images and pick colors . With this branding alternative, you can apply some visual changes effortlessly with zero CSS coding. You can: Supply your company logo and favicon Choose the background color for the page header Choose button colors Edit the footer text Once you supply your files, color values, and footer text, click on Save and see the changes take immediately by navigating to a different page or opening a new browser tab. Repeat the process till you get the combination that best matches your organization's look and feel. With \"Primary buttons\" we refer to the vast majority of buttons that trigger some action such as saving, updating or accepting - whether in the user pages or the admin UI itself. \"Cancel\" covers undo, close or cancel, while \"Misc\" is for anything not fitting any of the previous usages. You can choose \"Use defaults\" if you feel comfortable with the Bootstrap-like colors offered in Gluu Casa. Using the external assets directory # Note Intermediate-level knowledge of CSS is required for this task. Background # Casa's UI design is driven by one CSS stylesheet and a few images. Specifically, Casa leverages the following UI frameworks: ZK Bootstrap 4.4 Tachyons 4.11 Font Awesome 5.12 Particularly, ZK's default theme CSS file was disabled to offer a higher degree of flexibility in design. This enables Bootstrap and Tachyons to claim control over style rules applied to HTML markup. External assets directory # In the /opt/jans/jetty/casa/static folder, you can place your own version of the main stylesheet and images Casa uses. No other stylesheet should be overriden. To start, log in to the chroot and do the following: cd /opt/jans/jetty/casa/static jar -xf ../webapps/casa.war images styles/gluu/style.css This will copy the files you can edit later (these are the original versions provided out of the box in Casa). If you place additional files in this directory, ensure ownership is set to recursive. For instance, you can: $ chown -R jetty:jetty /opt/jans/jetty/casa/static/ Enable and apply your customizations # In the admin console, navigate to Custom branding > Use Casa external assets directory . From that point on, your installation is reading relevant files from the static directory. Note In CSS, the rules' order of appearance is important. Keep in mind that for all Casa pages, Bootstrap is loaded first, then style.css, and finally tachyons.css. This means rules for Tachyons have higher priority overall unless !important is used. The main stylesheet ( style.css ) is located at /opt/jans/jetty/casa/static/styles/gluu if you have followed the instructions above. Here are some tips for applying your customizations: Get acquainted with functional CSS. This is the approach followed in Casa. Here , here , and here you can find useful introductory material. Inspect the DOM tree generated for application pages and determine the CSS selectors you need to edit or things you have to add in order to alter the appearance. Use your web browser's facilities to inspect web page composition: this is usually part of any browser's developer toolbar. Moreover, they allow you to change styles on the fly so you can play a lot before applying the real changes. Don't override rules that are already defined in Bootstrap or Tachyons CSS files. Conversely, ZK rules (which are prefixed with z- ) are safe to be re-defined since ZK CSS isn't included (and style.css actually already redefines some). In most circumstances, your work will come down to editing existing rules in style.css . HTML markup will show rules (in the class attribute) prefixed with cust- that are apparently not defined anywhere. These rules are intended to give admins the opportunity to add their design tastes. The following is a list of custom selectors you can add to style.css . Names are in general self-explanatory, the images below help clarify more. cust-menu-item cust-content-heading cust-sections-wrapper cust-section cust-panel cust-modal-window cust-edit-button cust-link-button cust-delete-button cust-primary-button cust-cancel-button cust-misc-button cust-text-input cust-progress-bar Viewing your changes # There is no need to restart the application for the changes to take effect. However, most static files are cached by browsers, so you will need to open a fresh private browsing (incognito) session. If you tried the above and still don't see changes, try hitting the resource URL directly in a new browser tab. For example, to load the style.css file in your browser, visit https://<host-name>/casa/custom/styles/gluu/style.css . That way, you can determine if your changes are there. Reverting to Default Theme # If for any reason you wish to restore the default theme, select \"Use default (Gluu Inc.) theme\" in the admin dashboard. Examples # Here are solutions for common use cases: Use a different logo # Just replace images/logo.png (relative to the static directory) with your own image. Use a Different Favicon # Replace images/favicon.ico with your own image. Change the Font Used in Text # The vast majority of text that appears in the application uses the same font. To set the default font, locate at the bottom of style.css a declaration like @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com... and point to one of your choosing. Check out this page to learn more about Google fonts. Then, scroll down and modify the html and body selectors appropriately with the font you picked. If you want to use your own fonts instead of Google's, you can use @font-face for this purpose. Copy your ttf , woff , svg or eot files somewhere in the static directory and link them appropriately. To use the more classical fonts like \"Helvetica\", \"Arial\", etc., simply update html and body selectors passing the font-family name.","title":"Custom branding"},{"location":"casa/administration/custom-branding/#custom-branding","text":"In Casa, administrators can supply their own logo and favicon to better match the organization's look and feel.

Specifically, Casa leverages the following UI frameworks: ZK Bootstrap 4.4 Tachyons 4.11 Font Awesome 5.12 Particularly, ZK's default theme CSS file was disabled to offer a higher degree of flexibility in design.

From that point on, your installation is reading relevant files from the static directory. Note In CSS, the rules' order of appearance is important. Keep in mind that for all Casa pages, Bootstrap is loaded first, then style.css, and finally tachyons.css. This means rules for Tachyons have higher priority overall unless !important is used. The main stylesheet ( style.css ) is located at /opt/jans/jetty/casa/static/styles/gluu if you have followed the instructions above. Here are some tips for applying your customizations: Get acquainted with functional CSS. This is the approach followed in Casa. Here , here , and here you can find useful introductory material. Inspect the DOM tree generated for application pages and determine the CSS selectors you need to edit or things you have to add in order to alter the appearance. Use your web browser's facilities to inspect web page composition: this is usually part of any browser's developer toolbar. Moreover, they allow you to change styles on the fly so you can play a lot before applying the real changes. Don't override rules that are already defined in Bootstrap or Tachyons CSS files. Conversely, ZK rules (which are prefixed with z- ) are safe to be re-defined since ZK CSS isn't included (and style.css actually already redefines some). In most circumstances, your work will come down to editing existing rules in style.css . HTML markup will show rules (in the class attribute) prefixed with cust- that are apparently not defined anywhere. These rules are intended to give admins the opportunity to add their design tastes. The following is a list of custom selectors you can add to style.css . Names are in general self-explanatory, the images below help clarify more. cust-menu-item cust-content-heading cust-sections-wrapper cust-section cust-panel cust-modal-window cust-edit-button cust-link-button cust-delete-button cust-primary-button cust-cancel-button cust-misc-button cust-text-input cust-progress-bar","title":"Enable and apply your customizations"},{"location":"casa/administration/custom-branding/#viewing-your-changes","text":"There is no need to restart the application for the changes to take effect.

By default, Casa uses the INFO level for messages. You can change the log level at will using the app's admin UI. How do I custom brand Casa? # We have a dedicated page covering the topic of custom branding here . What ports are used by the application? # Casa uses port 8080 . One way to see if the app is up and running is by checking whether this port is open by issuing a command like netstat -nltp . How to turn 2FA off for a user? # If a user has been locked out for any reason (e.g. lost devices), you can reset his \"authentication method\" to password by accessing the admin console and choosing the menu item labelled \"Reset users preference\". Type the username (or part of) in the text field and then press search. Once you locate the user in the result grid, click the corresponding row and then hit \"Change to password\". The row will become disabled, and you'll see a success message. If you've followed the steps as described above, next time he attempts to log in, he won't be asked to present any credentials other than password to enter. How to adjust the issuer for OTP tokens # When people add OTP mobile apps, the enrollment appears in the device associated with an \"issuer\", so it is easy to recognize where the OTPs generated can be used. To keep track of which OTPs are valid for which IDPs, the issuer property can be adjusted in the Gluu Flex Server OTP script.

Admins may: Specify the minimum number of credentials users must enroll before 2FA can be used Allow 2FA to be automatically enabled upon credential enrollment Prevent users to turn 2FA on and off their own Allow users to choose a preferred method of authentication When (2) is not used, option (3) is disabled. This is the default behavior exhibited in Casa where users explicitly enable or disable 2FA usage. When (2) is active, 2FA is turned on as soon as the user enrolls a credential and the minimum required is fulfilled. Bear in mind: Automatic enablement happens only via GUI: enrollments made using the API will have to turn 2FA on by means of the API itself Plugins attaching authentication methods to Casa have to explicitly call method notifyEnrollment of SndFactorAuthenticationUtils upon successful enrollments (see the javadocs). Also, 2FA is automatically turned on upon login for users with enough credentials registered and not having 2FA turned on yet. With (4) users may choose a preferred type of credential. This means that when requested for a second factor, a credential of such \"preferred\" type will be prompted first instead of the credential considered the \"strongest\". The strength associated to a method is equal to the numeric level assigned to the custom script that represents the method. For more restrictive scenarios, administrators have the option to remove the 2FA switch (3) from the user's dashboard. Additionally this plugin allows to: Choose from a set of predefined policies for when 2FA should be prompted: Always (at every login attempt) When user's location is unrecognized When user's device is unrecognized Users can define their own policy (based on the above) Set how long a location or device can be deemed as recognized Moreover, when administrators allow users to set their own strong authentication policy, users can: View the list of physical devices they have used to login (e.g. PC, tablet, phone) View the time and location (city) associated to the last login event Remove a device from the list (eg. when it should not be considered trustworthy anymore) A device/location is considered trustworthy when the user has presented a strong credential in order to login to Casa in such device/location.

The purpose of the Gluu Server is to provide a central authentication service for many mobile and web applications. The purpose of Super Gluu is to enforce strong authentication for access to those apps that rely on the Gluu Server for login. Enable Super Gluu # To get started, log into the Gluu Server dashboard (a.k.a. oxTrust) and do the following: Navigate to Configuration > Manage Custom Scripts . In the Person Authentication tab find the super_gluu authentication module. Scroll down and find the Enable check box. Enable the script by clicking the check box. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Update . Now Super Gluu is an available authentication mechanism for your Gluu Server. This means that, using OpenID Connect acr_values , applications can now request Super Gluu authentication for users. Note To make sure Super Gluu has been enabled successfully, you can check your Gluu Server's OpenID Connect configuration by navigating to the following URL: https://<hostname>/.well-known/openid-configuration .

QR Code # During enrollment and authentication, the app goes through a few steps: The user scans the QR code, which contains identification data in the following format: { \"app\" : \"https://example.gluu.org\", \"state\" : \"dek4nwk6-dk56-sr43-4frt-4jfi30fltimd\" \"issuer\" : \"https://example.gluu.org\" \"created\" : \"2016-06-12T12:00:01.874000\" } Data from the QR code is changed into Fido U2F metadata: String discoveryUrl = oxPush2Request.getIssuer(); discoveryUrl += \"/.well-known/fido-u2f-configuration\"; final String discoveryJson = CommunicationService.get(discoveryUrl, null); final U2fMetaData u2fMetaData = new Gson().fromJson(discoveryJson, U2fMetaData.class); This metadata is sent to the server: ``` final List keyHandles = dataStore.getKeyHandlesByIssuerAndAppId(oxPush2Request.getIssuer(), oxPush2Request.getApp()); final boolean isEnroll = (keyHandles.size() == 0) || StringUtils.equals(oxPush2Request.getMethod(), \"enroll\"); final String u2fEndpoint; if (isEnroll) u2fEndpoint = u2fMetaData.getRegistrationEndpoint();// if enroll then get registration endpoint } else { u2fEndpoint = u2fMetaData.getAuthenticationEndpoint();// if authentication then get corresponding endpoint } validChallengeJsonResponse = CommunicationService.get(u2fEndpoint, parameters); ``` When the result comes back, it decides whether to enroll a new device or authenticate an existing one: if (isEnroll) { tokenResponse = oxPush2RequestListener.onEnroll(challengeJson, oxPush2Request, isDeny); } else { tokenResponse = oxPush2RequestListener.onSign(challengeJson, u2fMetaData.getIssuer(), isDeny); } Enrollment Process # If you scan a QR code for the first time and your device's UDID isn't attached to your user ID, the app will enroll it. First, it needs to prepare the data properties, as follows: > String version = request.getString(JSON_PROPERTY_VERSION); > String appParam = request.getString(JSON_PROPERTY_APP_ID); > String challenge = request.getString(JSON_PROPERTY_SERVER_CHALLENGE); > String origin = oxPush2Request.getIssuer(); > > EnrollmentResponse enrollmentResponse = u2fKey.register(new EnrollmentRequest(version, appParam, challenge, oxPush2Request)); During registration, the app generates a unique keyHandle and keyPair (public/private keys) to sign all data and uses an ECC algorithm to encode the required data, as follows: > TokenEntry tokenEntry = new TokenEntry(keyPairGenerator.keyPairToJson(keyPair), enrollmentRequest.getApplication(), enrollmentRequest.getOxPush2Request().getIssuer()); > . > . > . > dataStore.storeTokenEntry(keyHandle, tokenEntry); > byte[] userPublicKey = keyPairGenerator.encodePublicKey(keyPair.getPublic()); > > byte[] applicationSha256 = DigestUtils.sha256(application); > byte[] challengeSha256 = DigestUtils.sha256(challenge); > byte[] signedData = rawMessageCodec.encodeRegistrationSignedBytes(applicationSha256, challengeSha256, keyHandle, userPublicKey); > byte[] signature = keyPairGenerator.sign(signedData, certificatePrivateKey); > return new EnrollmentResponse(userPublicKey, keyHandle, vendorCertificate, signature); Now, all the data is converted into one-byte array, then one additional parameter is added, determining if the request is approved or denied, as follows: > JSONObject clientData = new JSONObject(); > if (isDeny){ > clientData.put(JSON_PROPERTY_REQUEST_TYPE, REGISTER_CANCEL_TYPE);//Deny > } else { > clientData.put(JSON_PROPERTY_REQUEST_TYPE, REQUEST_TYPE_REGISTER);//Approve > } > clientData.put(JSON_PROPERTY_SERVER_CHALLENGE, challenge); > clientData.put(JSON_PROPERTY_SERVER_ORIGIN, origin); > > String clientDataString = clientData.toString(); > byte[] resp = rawMessageCodec.encodeRegisterResponse(enrollmentResponse); > > JSONObject response = new JSONObject(); > response.put(\"registrationData\", Utils.base64UrlEncode(resp)); > response.put(\"clientData\", Utils.base64UrlEncode(clientDataString.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"ASCII\")))); > response.put(\"deviceData\", Utils.base64UrlEncode(deviceDataString.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"ASCII\")))); > > TokenResponse tokenResponse = new TokenResponse(); > tokenResponse.setResponse(response.toString()); > tokenResponse.setChallenge(new String(challenge)); > tokenResponse.setKeyHandle(new String(enrollmentResponse.getKeyHandle())); > > return tokenResponse; For authentication, all information is associated with your device UDID and the app retrieves the data from the data store each time, as follows: > TokenEntry tokenEntry = dataStore.getTokenEntry(keyHandle); > String keyPairJson = tokenEntry.getKeyPair(); > keyPair = keyPairGenerator.keyPairFromJson(keyPairJson); > int counter = dataStore.incrementCounter(keyHandle); > byte userPresence = userPresenceVerifier.verifyUserPresence(); > byte[] applicationSha256 = DigestUtils.sha256(application); > byte[] challengeSha256 = DigestUtils.sha256(challenge); > byte[] signedData = rawMessageCodec.encodeAuthenticateSignedBytes(applicationSha256, userPresence, counter, challengeSha256); > return new AuthenticateResponse(userPresence, counter, signature); The onEnroll and onSign methods prepare the parameters and data before the call to the server. For more information about these two methods, see the Super Gluu Git repo.

The app extracts some additional information from this result. Check enrollment or authentication success using the u2fOperationResult.getStatus() field, as follows: > LogInfo log = new LogInfo(); > log.setIssuer(oxPush2Request.getIssuer()); > log.setUserName(oxPush2Request.getUserName()); > log.setLocationIP(oxPush2Request.getLocationIP()); > log.setLocationAddress(oxPush2Request.getLocationCity()); > log.setCreatedDate(String.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis()));//oxPush2Request.getCreated()); > log.setMethod(oxPush2Request.getMethod()); Testing locally # The following is a method for testing Super Gluu locally on a non-public server. This guide assumes a Gluu Server has been installed and is operational. Warning The following testing steps mimic a MITM attack, so needless to say, these instructions are for development purposes only! In the Gluu Server VM settings, change the network adapter connection type from NAT to Bridged; The Gluu Server and smartphone should be connected to WiFi on the same local network Log into the VM and run ifconfig in the terminal to get the IP address of the Gluu Server In oxTrust, enable the Super Gluu authentication script Update the host file on the machine where you are running the browser to log in. Example: 192.168.1.232 c67.example.info Run ipconfig / ifconfig on the machine where you are planning to run your DNS server. Configure any DNS server to allow resovle u144.example.info.=192.168.1.232 . For example you can use a lightweight WindowsDNS DNS proxy server Create a dns.config file in the folder with dedserver.jar. Example file content: u144.example.info.=192.168.1.232 Checkut and build https://github.com/JonahAragon/WindowsDNS Run the DNS server using a command like this: java -jar dedserver.jar Create a dns.config file in the folder with dedserver.jar . Example file content: u144.example.info.=192.168.1.232 Run the DNS server using a command like this: java -jar dedserver.jar On your mobile phone, open the WiFi connection details and specify the DNS server IP from Step 6 Now you can test Super Gluu After you finish testing, don't forget to change your WiFi connection type on the mobile phone back to use the automatic settings.","title":"Developer Guide"},{"location":"supergluu/developer-guide/#super-gluu-developer-guide","text":"Super Gluu is a two-factor authentication mobile application for iOS and Android.

First, it needs to prepare the data properties, as follows: > String version = request.getString(JSON_PROPERTY_VERSION); > String appParam = request.getString(JSON_PROPERTY_APP_ID); > String challenge = request.getString(JSON_PROPERTY_SERVER_CHALLENGE); > String origin = oxPush2Request.getIssuer(); > > EnrollmentResponse enrollmentResponse = u2fKey.register(new EnrollmentRequest(version, appParam, challenge, oxPush2Request)); During registration, the app generates a unique keyHandle and keyPair (public/private keys) to sign all data and uses an ECC algorithm to encode the required data, as follows: > TokenEntry tokenEntry = new TokenEntry(keyPairGenerator.keyPairToJson(keyPair), enrollmentRequest.getApplication(), enrollmentRequest.getOxPush2Request().getIssuer()); > . > . > . > dataStore.storeTokenEntry(keyHandle, tokenEntry); > byte[] userPublicKey = keyPairGenerator.encodePublicKey(keyPair.getPublic()); > > byte[] applicationSha256 = DigestUtils.sha256(application); > byte[] challengeSha256 = DigestUtils.sha256(challenge); > byte[] signedData = rawMessageCodec.encodeRegistrationSignedBytes(applicationSha256, challengeSha256, keyHandle, userPublicKey); > byte[] signature = keyPairGenerator.sign(signedData, certificatePrivateKey); > return new EnrollmentResponse(userPublicKey, keyHandle, vendorCertificate, signature); Now, all the data is converted into one-byte array, then one additional parameter is added, determining if the request is approved or denied, as follows: > JSONObject clientData = new JSONObject(); > if (isDeny){ > clientData.put(JSON_PROPERTY_REQUEST_TYPE, REGISTER_CANCEL_TYPE);//Deny > } else { > clientData.put(JSON_PROPERTY_REQUEST_TYPE, REQUEST_TYPE_REGISTER);//Approve > } > clientData.put(JSON_PROPERTY_SERVER_CHALLENGE, challenge); > clientData.put(JSON_PROPERTY_SERVER_ORIGIN, origin); > > String clientDataString = clientData.toString(); > byte[] resp = rawMessageCodec.encodeRegisterResponse(enrollmentResponse); > > JSONObject response = new JSONObject(); > response.put(\"registrationData\", Utils.base64UrlEncode(resp)); > response.put(\"clientData\", Utils.base64UrlEncode(clientDataString.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"ASCII\")))); > response.put(\"deviceData\", Utils.base64UrlEncode(deviceDataString.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"ASCII\")))); > > TokenResponse tokenResponse = new TokenResponse(); > tokenResponse.setResponse(response.toString()); > tokenResponse.setChallenge(new String(challenge)); > tokenResponse.setKeyHandle(new String(enrollmentResponse.getKeyHandle())); > > return tokenResponse; For authentication, all information is associated with your device UDID and the app retrieves the data from the data store each time, as follows: > TokenEntry tokenEntry = dataStore.getTokenEntry(keyHandle); > String keyPairJson = tokenEntry.getKeyPair(); > keyPair = keyPairGenerator.keyPairFromJson(keyPairJson); > int counter = dataStore.incrementCounter(keyHandle); > byte userPresence = userPresenceVerifier.verifyUserPresence(); > byte[] applicationSha256 = DigestUtils.sha256(application); > byte[] challengeSha256 = DigestUtils.sha256(challenge); > byte[] signedData = rawMessageCodec.encodeAuthenticateSignedBytes(applicationSha256, userPresence, counter, challengeSha256); > return new AuthenticateResponse(userPresence, counter, signature); The onEnroll and onSign methods prepare the parameters and data before the call to the server. For more information about these two methods, see the Super Gluu Git repo. Now, the app makes one last call to the server: > final Map<String, String> parameters = new HashMap<String, String>(); > parameters.put(\"username\", oxPush2Request.getUserName()); > parameters.put(\"tokenResponse\", tokenResponse.getResponse()); > > final String resultJsonResponse = CommunicationService.post(u2fEndpoint, parameters); The string resultJsonResponse contains the JSON result. The app extracts some additional information from this result. Check enrollment or authentication success using the u2fOperationResult.getStatus() field, as follows: > LogInfo log = new LogInfo(); > log.setIssuer(oxPush2Request.getIssuer()); > log.setUserName(oxPush2Request.getUserName()); > log.setLocationIP(oxPush2Request.getLocationIP()); > log.setLocationAddress(oxPush2Request.getLocationCity()); > log.setCreatedDate(String.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis()));//oxPush2Request.getCreated()); > log.setMethod(oxPush2Request.getMethod());","title":"Enrollment Process"},{"location":"supergluu/developer-guide/#testing-locally","text":"The following is a method for testing Super Gluu locally on a non-public server. This guide assumes a Gluu Server has been installed and is operational. Warning The following testing steps mimic a MITM attack, so needless to say, these instructions are for development purposes only! In the Gluu Server VM settings, change the network adapter connection type from NAT to Bridged; The Gluu Server and smartphone should be connected to WiFi on the same local network Log into the VM and run ifconfig in the terminal to get the IP address of the Gluu Server In oxTrust, enable the Super Gluu authentication script Update the host file on the machine where you are running the browser to log in. Example: 192.168.1.232 c67.example.info Run ipconfig / ifconfig on the machine where you are planning to run your DNS server. Configure any DNS server to allow resovle u144.example.info.=192.168.1.232 . For example you can use a lightweight WindowsDNS DNS proxy server Create a dns.config file in the folder with dedserver.jar. Example file content: u144.example.info.=192.168.1.232 Checkut and build https://github.com/JonahAragon/WindowsDNS Run the DNS server using a command like this: java -jar dedserver.jar Create a dns.config file in the folder with dedserver.jar . Example file content: u144.example.info.=192.168.1.232 Run the DNS server using a command like this: java -jar dedserver.jar On your mobile phone, open the WiFi connection details and specify the DNS server IP from Step 6 Now you can test Super Gluu After you finish testing, don't forget to change your WiFi connection type on the mobile phone back to use the automatic settings.","title":"Testing locally"},{"location":"supergluu/user-guide/","tags":["Super Gluu","User Guide"],"text":"Super Gluu User Guide # This guide will show how to use the Super Gluu two-factor authentication mobile application.

A key is a unique file that is generated during enrollment and is used to authenticate the device on the server. If a key for a server is deleted, enroll again with a new key. Note If you delete a key from your app but wish to re-enroll the same device against the same server, the corresponding entry for that device also needs to be removed from the user record in the Flex. To change a key's name, swipe left on it and tap the green button. To delete a key, swipe left on the key, then tap the red button. Settings # In the Settings tab, there are options to configure the passcode or TouchID. Push Notifications # Super Gluu can receive push notifications from Flex. The server can send an enrollment or authentication request to the application, as if it scanned the QR code directly. After choosing to receive push notifications either during initial setup or through the Settings tab later, enroll through the server. Super Gluu will send a token to the server, which will be used to send push notifications to the device. After receiving the notification, tap Approve or Deny directly from the push menu. Super Gluu can receive a notification when the application is running in the foreground. It will look just like the original authentication screen.
