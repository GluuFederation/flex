/**
 * Note: This test file has been migrated from Redux Saga to React Query.
 * The original saga-based integration tests have been replaced with
 * React Query hook mocks in the component tests.
 *
 * For true API integration testing, consider:
 * 1. Setting up MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking
 * 2. Creating end-to-end tests with tools like Playwright or Cypress
 * 3. Using the actual API endpoints in a test environment
