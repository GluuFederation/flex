/**
 * NOTE: These tests have been temporarily disabled as part of the migration
 * from Redux Sagas to React Query (Orval-generated hooks).
 *
 * The user management plugin has been fully migrated to use:
 * - React Query hooks (useGetUser, usePostUser, usePutUser, useDeleteUser)
 * - No more Redux sagas or slices for user management
 *
 * These tests need to be rewritten to test the React Query hooks directly
 * using React Testing Library and MSW (Mock Service Worker) instead of
 * redux-saga-test-plan.
 *
 * TODO: Rewrite these tests for React Query
