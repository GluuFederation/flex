6. Support. 
 
6.1 Gluu will provide Customer with the level of Support indicated on the applicable Order and paid for by Customer. Customers are not required to purchase support from Gluu to use the Software.
 
7. Fees. 
 
7.1 Customer will pay Gluu the Fees in advance, within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice, unless explicitly otherwise indicated in the applicable Order or SOW. All payments are non-cancelable, not subject to the Limitation of Liability in Section 12 below, and shall be made in the currency stated on the applicable Order. Fees are non-refundable except to the extent expressly provided for in this Agreement. Late payments will bear interest at the lesser of one- and one-half percent (1 ½%) per month or the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. Customer will reimburse Gluu for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in collecting any overdue amounts.
 
7.2 All Fees payable by Customer are exclusive of applicable taxes and duties (such as, without limitation, VAT, Service Tax, GST, excise taxes, sales and transactions taxes, and gross receipts tax (collectively, the “Transaction Taxes”). If applicable, Gluu may charge and Customer shall pay all Transaction Taxes that Gluu is legally obligated or authorized to collect from Customer. Customer will provide such information to Gluu as reasonably required to determine whether Gluu is obligated to collect Transaction Taxes from Customer. Gluu will not collect, and Customer will not pay, any Transaction Taxes for which Customer furnishes a properly completed exemption certificate or a direct payment permit certificate for which Gluu may claim an available exemption from such Transaction Taxes. All payments made by Customer to Gluu under this Agreement will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding, as may be required by law. If any such deduction or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes) is required on any payment, Customer will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by Gluu is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. Gluu will provide Customer with such tax forms as are reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under this Agreement.
 
7.3 Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for Gluu to provide a purchase order (“PO”) number on Gluu’s invoice (or otherwise). If Customer sends Gluu a PO in lieu of executing an Order, the PO will be deemed a binding contract offer which Gluu may accept by (i) signing the PO or (ii) sending a written order acknowledgment of acceptance of the PO (thereby forming a mutually agreed Order governed by this Agreement). In any event, only the Commercial Details listed on PO shall be considered part of the Order created (exclusive of any pre-printed terms on the PO). Any other terms on the PO which either (i) conflict with the terms of this Agreement, or (ii) are not agreed under this Agreement, will be void and without effect, even if Gluu signs the PO. All accepted POs will automatically be governed by this Agreement (even if the PO does not reference this Agreement). It is expressly agreed that Section 7 shall apply in respect of any PO sent by Customer and accepted by Gluu.
 
8. Records Retention and Audit. 
 
8.1 During any Subscription Term and for at least one (1) year thereafter, Customer shall maintain complete and accurate records to permit Gluu to verify Customer’s compliance with this Agreement (including the number of Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices used by Customer as well as Customer’s compliance with its obligations post-termination or expiration), and provide Gluu with such records within ten (10) days of request.
 
8.2 Every three (3) months within a Subscription Term (or on another cadence as mutually agreed between the parties), Customer shall self-certify to Gluu the total number of Licensed Nodes and Licensed Devices currently deployed and used by Customer in each cluster running in a production, test, or development environment. Such self-certification shall be in accordance with Gluu’s instruction and in the form of either a (i) written report signed by an authorized representative of Customer or (ii) copy of an automatically generated report created by Customer. Gluu will review such reports and determine if any true up to the applicable Order is required. Additional fees for any excess usage shall be calculated based on the fees specified in the Order for the applicable Licensed Node or Licensed Device size and type, and prorated, as applicable. If the excess usage includes nodes or device sizes or types for which fees are not specified in the applicable existing Order, then additional fees shall be calculated based on Gluu's list price in effect at the time and prorated, as applicable.
 
8.3 Upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, but no more than once in any (12) twelve month period, Gluu may audit Customer’s use of the Software solely as necessary to verify Customer’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement during the Subscription Term and for one (1) year thereafter. Any such audit will be conducted during regular business hours at Customer’s facilities and will not unreasonably interfere with Customer’s business activities. Customer will provide Gluu with access to the relevant Customer records and facilities.
 
9. Confidentiality. 
 
9.1 Customer and Gluu will maintain the confidentiality of Confidential Information. “Confidential Information”  means any proprietary information received by the other party during, or prior to entering into, this Agreement that a party should know is confidential or proprietary based on the circumstances surrounding the disclosure, including the Software and any non-public technical, business and financial information (including Commercial Details). Confidential Information does not include information that (a) is or becomes generally known to the public through no fault of or breach of this Agreement by the receiving party; (b) is rightfully known by the receiving party at the time of disclosure without an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party; (c) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; or (d) the receiving party rightfully obtains from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure.
 
9.2 The receiving party of any Confidential Information of the other party agrees not to use such Confidential Information for any purpose except as necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. The receiving party shall protect the secrecy of and prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information using the same degree of care that it takes to protect its own confidential information and in no event shall use less than reasonable care.
 
9.3 Upon termination of this Agreement, the receiving party will, at the disclosing party’s option, promptly return or destroy (and provide written certification of such destruction) the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or regulation.
