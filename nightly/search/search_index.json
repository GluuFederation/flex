With Helm charts available out of the box, Gluu Flex can handle the most demanding requirements for concurrency. Thanks to cloud-native auto-scaling and zero downtime updates, you can build a robust, multi-datacenter topology. You can take advantage of new cloud databases like Amazon Aurora and Google Spanner. Common use cases include: Single sign-on (SSO) Mobile authentication API access management Two-factor authentication (2FA) Customer identity and access management (CIAM) Identity federation Built on Janssen # Gluu Flex is a downstream product of the Linux Foundation Janssen Project . It was created for enterprise customers who want a commercially supported distribution, plus some additional tools to ease administration. Harness Low Code Authentication Flows with Agama # Gluu Flex uses Agama to offer an alternative way to build web-based authentication flows. Traditionally, person authentication flows are defined in the server with jython scripts that adhere to a predefined API. With Agama, flows are coded using a DSL (domain specific language) designed for the sole purpose of writing web flows. Agama flows are simpler, more intuitive, and quicker to build.

Here, we'll explore the working mechanism of the Gluu Flex Admin UI, focusing on its interaction with the Jans Auth Server and the key steps involved. When accessing the Gluu Flex Admin UI through a web browser, the following steps are involved: License Verification # The user accesses the Gluu Flex Admin UI frontend through a web browser. The frontend requests the Admin UI backend to retrieve Admin UI configuration from Janssen persistence. The Admin UI configuration includes OIDC client details for accessing the Auth Server, OIDC client details for accessing the Token Server, OIDC client details for accessing the License APIs, and license metadata. It's important to note that the Admin UI backend is implemented as a Jans Config API plugin . The frontend calls the Admin UI backend API ( /isConfigValid ) to validate the license configuration in persistence, essentially verifying the validity of the OIDC client used to access the License APIs. If it is not valid, the same API tries to register a new OIDC client using the SSA uploaded during installation. In case the SSA is invalid, the Admin UI shows a page to upload a new valid SSA. To minimize network calls to account.gluu.org, /isConfigValid verifies the OIDC client validity only at a set interval (default: 30 days). Otherwise, /isConfigValid checks if the required OIDC client for License APIs exists in the Admin UI configuration (persistence). After validating the OIDC client, the Admin UI calls the backend API (/isActive) to check if a valid license is present in the license configuration. It verifies whether the license key and its details are valid and not expired. At regular intervals (default is 30 days), the Admin UI backend calls the SCAN API (/scan/license/isActive) to verify license validity and sync its details into the license configuration (persistence). If a valid license is not present, the frontend calls the backend API (/retrieve) to retrieve the license for the user via the SCAN API (/scan/license/retrieve). The license can only be retrieved from SCAN if the user has subscribed to the Admin UI license in Agama Lab. If the user has not already subscribed to a valid license in Agama Lab, the Admin UI displays a page to generate a 30-day trial license. The user cannot generate another trial license after expiry of a generated trial license and will need to subscribe to the Admin UI license in Agama Lab to access the user interface. After verification of valid license the frontend initiates the Authorization Code Flow by redirecting the user to the login page. sequenceDiagram title License Verification autonumber actor User User->>Browser: open Admin UI URL Browser->>Gluu Flex Admin UI: launch Admin UI Gluu Flex Admin UI->>Admin UI Backend: /config Admin UI Backend->>Gluu Flex Admin UI: Admin UI config Gluu Flex Admin UI->>Admin UI Backend: /license/isConfigValid Note over Gluu Flex Admin UI,Admin UI Backend: validate license OIDC client alt license client valid Admin UI Backend->>Gluu Flex Admin UI: true else license client invalid Admin UI Backend->>account.gluu.org: DCR using SSA alt DCR success account.gluu.org->>Admin UI Backend: client credentials Admin UI Backend->>Admin UI Backend: save client credentials in persistence Admin UI Backend->>Gluu Flex Admin UI: true else DCR fails Admin UI Backend->>Gluu Flex Admin UI: false Gluu Flex Admin UI->>Browser: Screen to Upload SSA end end Gluu Flex Admin UI->>Admin UI Backend: /license/isActive Note over Gluu Flex Admin UI,Admin UI Backend: validate license Admin UI Backend->>SCAN: /scan/license/isActive alt license active SCAN->>Admin UI Backend: true else license inactive / not present SCAN->>Admin UI Backend: false Admin UI Backend->>SCAN: /retrieve alt license subscribed SCAN->>Admin UI Backend: license else license not subscribed SCAN->>Admin UI Backend: false Admin UI Backend->>Gluu Flex Admin UI: false Gluu Flex Admin UI->>Browser: Screen to generate Trial license end end Admin UI Backend->>Gluu Flex Admin UI: login page The Authorization Code Flow # The frontend initiates the Authorization Code Flow by calling authorization url and redirecting the user to the login page of the Janssen authorization server for user authentication.

One of the key services offered by Gluu Flex is the ability to view and edit configuration properties, interception scripts, clients, users, metrics, and more, all in one place. This user-friendly interface facilitates interaction with the Jans Auth Server through a REST API layer known as the Jans Config API. The above diagram explains interaction between various depending components. Admin UI Frontend # This user facing GUI has been developed using React.js and Redux is used for state management. The Admin UI utilizes an OpenAPI JavaScript client for Jans Config API, facilitating API calls to Jans Config API endpoints. The GUI utilizes popular libraries such as Material-UI , Axios, Formik , etc. Webpack is responsible for compiling and bundling the application, optimizing its performance, and generating the necessary production files. The Admin UI bundle is hosted on an Apache HTTP server , which is included as a component with the Janssen server installation. This setup ensures that the GUI is readily accessible and efficiently served to users. Admin UI Backend # The GUI utilizes a dedicated Java backend to handle specific tasks, such as reading the Admin UI configuration from persistence, managing Admin UI roles and permission mapping in configuration, performing audit logging, and making calls to license APIs on SCAN. The Jans Config API follows a flexible plugin architecture, allowing the addition of new APIs through extensions known as plugins, without the need to modify the core application. The Admin UI Backend has been incorporated into the Jans Config API as a plugin to address Admin UI-specific tasks.

The seamless integration of webhooks into this interface enhances its functionality, offering a dynamic and extensible solution. Webhooks are a mechanism for automating workflows by allowing external systems to be notified of specific events. In the context of Gluu Flex Admin UI, webhooks can be mapped to various Admin UI features to execute custom business logic when events associated with those features occur. Administrators can map one or more webhooks to specific feature events using the user interface. Webhook management on the UI # The webhook create/update form consists for following fields.

It is a downstream commercial distribution of the Linux Foundation Janssen Project software, plus a web administration tool(Gluu Admin-UI). SUSE Rancher\u2019s helm-based deployment approach simplifies the deployment and configuration of Flex, enabling organizations to take advantage of Flex\u2019s modular design to improve their security posture while simultaneously enabling just-in-time auto-scaling. The key services of Flex include: (REQUIRED) Jans Auth Server : This component is the OAuth Authorization Server, the OpenID Connect Provider, and the UMA Authorization Server for person and software authentication. This service must be Internet-facing. (REQUIRED) Jans Config API : The API to configure the auth-server and other components is consolidated in this component. This service should not be Internet-facing. Gluu Admin UI : Web admin tool for ad-hoc configuration. Jans Fido : This component provides the server-side endpoints to enroll and validate devices that use FIDO. It provides both FIDO U2F (register, authenticate) and FIDO 2 (attestation, assertion) endpoints. This service must be Internet-facing. Jans SCIM : System for Cross-domain Identity Management ( SCIM ) is JSON/REST API to manage user data. Use it to add, edit and update user information. This service should not be Internet-facing. Jans Casa : A self-service web portal for end-users to manage authentication and authorization preferences for their account in the Gluu Flex server. Typically, it enables people to manage their MFA credentials, like FIDO tokens and OTP authenticators. It's also extensible if your organization has any other self-service requirements. Building Blocks # Scope # In this Quickstart Guide, we will: Deploy Flex and add some users. Enable two-factor authentication. Protect content on an Apache web server with OpenID Connect. Audience # This document is intended for DevOps engineers, site reliability engineers (SREs), platform engineers, software engineers, and developers who are responsible for managing and running stateful workloads in Kubernetes clusters. Technical overview # In addition to the core services listed in the Introduction above, the SUSE Rancher deployment includes the following components: PostgreSQL/MySQL : SQL database dialect used to store configuration, people clients, sessions and other data needed for Gluu Flex operation. Cert Manager : Used for managing X.509 certificates and crypto keys lifecycle in Janssen Server. Key Rotation : A cronjob that implements Cert Manager to rotate the auth keys Configuration job : loads (generate/restore) and dumps (backup) the configuration and secrets. Persistence job : This job loads initial data for the backend used (SQL or Couchbase). ConfigMaps : Stores configuration needed for Flex environment setup. Secrets : Contains sensitive or confidential data such as a password, a token, or a key. Config and Secret keys # The Configuration job creates a set of configurations and secrets used by all services in the Flex setup. To check the values of the configuration keys(configmaps) in the installation: kubectl get cm cn -o json -n <namespace> To check the values of the secret keys in installation: kubectl get secret cn -o json -n <namespace> Gluu Config Keys # Key Example Values admin_email team@gluu.org admin_inum d3afef58-c026-4514-9d4c-e0a3efb4c29d admin_ui_client_id 1901.a6575c1e-4688-4c11-8c95-d9e570b13ee8 auth_enc_keys RSA1_5 RSA-OAEP auth_key_rotated_at 1653517558 auth_legacyIdTokenClaims false auth_openidScopeBackwardCompatibility false auth_openid_jks_fn /etc/certs/auth-keys.jks auth_openid_jwks_fn /etc/certs/auth-keys.json casa_client_id 0008-db36db1f-025e-4164-aeed-f82df064eee8 auth_sig_keys RS256 RS384 RS512 ES256 ES384 ES512 PS384 PS512 city Austin country_code US default_openid_jks_dn_name CN=Janssen Auth CA Certificate fido2ConfigFolder /etc/jans/conf/fido2 hostname demoexample.gluu.org jca_client_id 1801.4df6c3ba-ebf6-4836-8fb5-6da927586f61 optional_scopes [\\\"casa\\\", \\\"sql\\\", \\\"fido2\\\", \\\"scim\\\"] orgName Gluu tui_client_id 2000.9313cd4b-147c-4a67-96be-8a69ddbaf7e9 scim_client_id 1201.1cbcc731-3fca-4668-a480-1b5f5a7d6a53 state TX token_server_admin_ui_client_id 1901.57a858dc-69f3-4967-befe-e089fe376638 Gluu Secret Keys # Key Example Values admin_ui_client_encoded_pw QlBMMTZUZWVYeWczVlpNUk1XN0pzdzrg admin_ui_client_pw WnJYZEcyVlNBWG9d auth_jks_base64 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx auth_openid_jks_pass TWZoR3Rlb0NnUHEP auth_openid_key_base64 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx casa_client_encoded_pw b3NabG9oVGNncFVVWFpxNEJMU3V0dzrg casa_client_pw M1g0Z1dEbGNPQ19d encoded_admin_password e3NzaGF9eGpOaDRyblU3dzJZbmpPclovMUlheTdkR0RrOTdLe encoded_salt Um9NSEJnOU9IbTRvRkJHVVZETVZIeXEP jca_client_encoded_pw Um9NSEJnOU9IbTRvRkJHVVZETVZIeX58 jca_client_pw Um9NSEJnOU9IbTRvR otp_configuration xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx pairwiseCalculationKey ZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638ZHd2VW pairwiseCalculationSalt ZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638ZHd2VW0 plugins_admin_ui_properties xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx tui_client_encoded_pw ZHd2VW01Y3VOUW66388PS512 tui_client_pw AusZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638 scim_client_encoded_pw UZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638ZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638 scim_client_pw ZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638 sql_password ZHd2VW01Y3V638 ssl_ca_cert xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ssl_ca_key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ssl_cert xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ssl_csr xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ssl_key xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx token_server_admin_ui_client_encoded_pw Q1Z1cmtYWUlYSVg4U2tLTldVcnZVTUF token_server_admin_ui_client_pw ZHd2VW01Y3VOUW6638 Prerequisites # SUSE Rancher installed with an accessible UI Kubernetes cluster running on SUSE Rancher with at least 1 worker node Sufficient RBAC permissions to deploy and manage applications in the cluster. LinuxIO kernel modules on the worker nodes Docker running locally (Linux preferred) Essential tools and CLI utilities are installed on your local workstation and are available in your $PATH : curl , kubectl An entry in the /etc/hosts file of your local workstation to resolve the hostname of the Gluu Flex installation. This step is for testing purposes. Installation # Summary of steps : Install Database: Note For the Database test setup to work, a PV provisioner support must be present in the underlying infrastructure. Install PostgreSQL database # Note If you are willing to use MySQL installation, skip this section and head to the Install MySQL section. To install a quick setup with PostgreSQL as the backend, you need to provide the connection parameters of a fresh setup. For a test setup, you can follow the below instructions: Apps --> Charts and search for Postgres . Click on Install on the right side of the window. Create a new namespace called postgres and hit Next . You should be on the Edit YAML page. Modify the below keys as desired. These values will be inputted in the installation of Gluu Flex Key auth.database auth.username auth.password Click Install at the bottom right of the page. Install MySQL database # Note Skip this section if you installed PostgreSQL . This section is only needed if you are willing to use MySQL. To install a quick setup with MySQL as the backend, you need to provide the connection parameters of a fresh setup. For a test setup, you can follow the below instructions: Open a kubectl shell from the top right navigation menu >_ . Run: helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami helm repo update kubectl create ns gluu #Create gluu namespace Pass in a custom password for the database. Here we used Test1234# . The admin user will be left as root . Notice we are installing in the gluu namespace. Run helm install my-release --set auth.rootPassword=Test1234#,auth.database=jans bitnami/mysql -n gluu Successful Installation # After the installation is successful, you should have a Statefulset active in the rancher UI as shown in the screenshot below. Install Nginx-Ingress , if you are not using Istio ingress helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable helm repo update helm install nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx To get the Loadbalancer IP: kubectl get svc nginx-ingress-nginx-controller --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}' Install Gluu Flex: Head to Apps --> Charts and search for Gluu Click on Install on the right side of the window. Change the namespace from default to gluu , then click on Next . Scroll through the sections to get familiar with the options. For minimal setup follow with the next instructions. Add License SSA . Before initiating the setup, please obtain an SSA for Flex trial, after which you will issued a JWT. Click on the Persistence section. Change SQL database host uri to postgresql.postgres.svc.cluster.local in the case of PostgreSQL or my-release-mysql.gluu.svc.cluster.local in the case of MySQL . Also set SQL database username , SQL password , and SQL database name to the values you used during the database installation. To enable Casa and the Admin UI, navigate to the Optional Services section and check the Enable casa and boolean flag to enable admin UI boxes. You can also enable different services like Client API and Jackrabbit . Click on the section named Ingress and enable all the endpoints. You might add LB IP or address if you don't have FQDN for Gluu . To pass your FQDN or Domain that is intended to serve the Gluu Flex IDP, head to the Configuration section: Add your FQDN and check the box Is the FQDN globally resolvable . Click on the Edit YAML tab and add your FQDN to nginx-ingress.ingress.hosts and nginx-ingress.ingress.tls.hosts . Click on Install on the bottom right of the window. Note You can upgrade your installation after the deployment. To do that, go to the SUSE Rancher Dashboard -> Apps -> Installed Apps -> gluu -> Click on the 3 dots on the right -> Upgrade -> Make your changes -> Click Update. The running deployment and services of different Gluu Flex components like casa , admin-ui , scim , auth-server , etc can be viewed by navigating through the SUSE Rancher. Go to Workloads and see the running pods. Go under Service Discovery and checkout the Ingresses and Services . All deployed components should be in a healthy and running state like in the screenshot shown below. Connecting to the Setup # Note You can skip this section if you have a globally resolvable FQDN . In the event you used microk8s or your fqdn is not registered, the below steps will help with connecting to your setup. To access the setup from a browser or another VM, we need to change the ingress class annotation from kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx to kubernetes.io/ingress.class: public e.g., for the specific component you want to access publicly in the browser; Navigate through the SUSE Rancher UI to Service Discovery -> Ingresses Choose the ingress for the targeted component. For example gluu-nginx-ingress-auth-server for auth-server Click on the three dots in the top right corner Click on Edit Yaml On line 8, change the kubernetes.io/ingress.class annotation value from nginx to public Click Save The LoadBalancer IP needs to get mapped inside /etc/hosts with the domain chosen for gluu flex . If the domain you used in the setup is demoexample.gluu.org: 3.65.27.95 demoexample.gluu.org You can do the same edit for every component you want to access publicly from the browser. Testing Configuration endpoints # Try accessing some Gluu Flex endpoints like https://demoexample.gluu.org/.well-known/openid-configuration in the browser and you'll get back a JSON response; Note that you can also access those endpoints via curl command, E.g. curl -k https://demoexample.gluu.org/.well-known/openid-configuration You should get a similar response like the one below; {\"version\":\"1.1\",\"issuer\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org\",\"attestation\":{\"base_path\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-fido2/restv1/attestation\",\"options_enpoint\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-fido2/restv1/attestation/options\",\"result_enpoint\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-fido2/restv1/attestation/result\"},\"assertion\":{\"base_path\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-fido2/restv1/assertion\",\"options_enpoint\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-fido2/restv1/assertion/options\",\"result_enpoint\":\"https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-fido2/restv1/assertion/result\"}} Login and Add a New User # After inputting the license keys, you can then use admin and the password you set to login to the Admin UI and you should see the Admin UI dashboard. You could also add another test user via the admin UI that will be used for testing Casa and 2FA as shown in the screenshot below. Navigate to Users and click on + in the top right corner to add a user. Testing Casa # Jans Casa (\"Casa\") is a self-service web portal for managing account security preferences. The primary use case for Casa is self-service 2FA, but other use cases and functionalities can be supported via Casa plugins. Although you have not enabled two-factor authentication yet, you should still be able to login to Casa as the admin user and the password is the one you set during installation. Point your browser to https://demoexample.gluu.org/jans-casa and you should be welcomed by the Casa login page as shown below. After logging in, you'll be welcomed by the home page as shown below. Enabling Two-Factor Authentication # In this part, we are going to enable two standard authentication mechanisms: OTP and FIDO. This can be done through the admin UI. 2FA can be turned on by clicking the switch in the Second Factor Authentication widget. By default, you will be able to choose from a few 2FA policies: Always (upon every login attempt) If the location (e.g. city) detected in the login attempt is unrecognized If the device used to login is unrecognized To reduce the chance of account lockout, enroll at least two different types of 2FA credentials -- e.g. one security key and one OTP app; or one OTP app and one SMS phone number, etc. This way, regardless of which device you're using to access a protected resource, you will have a usable option for passing strong authentication. To enable 2FA, firstly the OTP and FIDO components have to be enabled in the Casa admin UI then login to Casa as an end user, and register an OTP device (i.e. Google Authenticator) and a FIDO device. Register OTP device To add a new OTP token, navigate to 2FA credentials > OTP Tokens. You can either add a soft OTP token by choosing the Soft token option or a hard token by choosing the Hard Token Option Check the soft OTP token and click ready Before proceeding to the next step, Download Google Authenticator from Google Play or Appstore Then proceed and scan the QR code with your app Enter the 6-digit code that appears in your authenticator app and validate the enrollment.

Click the pencil to edit the device's nickname Testing Apache OIDC Locally # In this part, we are going to use docker to locally configure an apache web server, and then install the mod_auth_openidc module and configure it accordingly. Using local docker containers, our approach is to first register a client, then spin up two Apache containers, one serving static content (with server-side includes configured so we can display headers and environment information), and one acting as the OpenID Connect authenticating reverse proxy. Register an OpenID Connect client # On the Janssen server, you can register a new client in the Flex Admin UI or the jans-cli. In this section, we are going to show both ways of doing it from the Admin UI and using jans-cli Admin UI # Navigate to Auth server -> Clients and click on + in the top right corner to create a client. Take note of the following keys:values because they configure the right client that we need scopes: email_,openid_,profile responseTypes: code The screenshot below shows an example of the Admin UI section from where a client is created Jans TUI # On the Janssen server, we are going to register a new client using the jans-cli. There are two ways you can register an OIDC client with the Janssen server, Manual Client Registration and Dynamic Client Registration (DCR). Here we will use manual client registration. We will use jans-tui tool provided by the Janssen server. jans-tui has a menu-driven interface that makes it easy to configure the Janssen server. Here we will use the menu-driven approach to register a new client. Download jans-cli-tui from the release assets depending on your OS. For example: wget https://github.com/JanssenProject/jans/releases/download/nightly/jans-cli-tui-linux-ubuntu-X86-64.pyz Now we have jans-cli-tui-linux-ubuntu-X86-64.pyz downloaded. Now we can grab the FQDN, client-id, client-secret, and connect using the following commands: FQDN= #Add your FQDN here TUI_CLIENT_ID=$(kubectl get cm cn -n <namespace> --template={{.data.tui_client_id}}) TUI_CLIENT_SECRET=$(kubectl get secret cn -n <namespace> --template={{.data.tui_client_pw}} | base64 -d) #add -noverify if your FQDN is not registered Get schema file using this command python3 jans-cli-tui-linux-ubuntu-X86-64.pyz --host <FQDN> --client-id <TUI_CLIENT_ID> --client-secret <TUI_CLIENT_SECRET> --no-tui --schema /components/schemas/Client Add values for required params and store this JSON in a text file.

It is a downstream commercial distribution of the Linux Foundation Janssen Project software, plus a web administration tool(Gluu Admin-UI). SUSE Rancher\u2019s helm-based deployment approach simplifies the deployment and configuration of Flex, enabling organizations to take advantage of Flex\u2019s modular design to improve their security posture while simultaneously enabling just-in-time auto-scaling. The key services of Flex include: (REQUIRED) Jans Auth Server : This component is the OAuth Authorization Server, the OpenID Connect Provider, and the UMA Authorization Server for person and software authentication. This service must be Internet-facing. (REQUIRED) Jans Config API : The API to configure the auth-server and other components is consolidated in this component. This service should not be Internet-facing. Gluu Admin UI : Web admin tool for ad-hoc configuration. Jans Fido : This component provides the server-side endpoints to enroll and validate devices that use FIDO. It provides both FIDO U2F (register, authenticate) and FIDO 2 (attestation, assertion) endpoints. This service must be Internet-facing. Jans SCIM : System for Cross-domain Identity Management ( SCIM ) is JSON/REST API to manage user data. Use it to add, edit and update user information. This service should not be Internet-facing. Jans Casa : A self-service web portal for end-users to manage authentication and authorization preferences for their account in the Gluu Flex server. Typically, it enables people to manage their MFA credentials, like FIDO tokens and OTP authenticators. It's also extensible if your organization has any other self-service requirements.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"admin/recipes/getting-started-rancher/#building-blocks","text":"","title":"Building Blocks"},{"location":"admin/recipes/getting-started-rancher/#scope","text":"In this Quickstart Guide, we will: Deploy Flex and add some users.

That's because in order to do anything useful with Gluu Flex, you need a minimal amount of configuration. For example, you need to generate cryptographic key pairs, you need to generate a minimal amount of data in the database, you need to generate some web server TLS certificates. For this reason, for most of the platforms, installation is a three step process. Step 1, install the bits. Step 2, run \"setup\" and answer some basic question (like the hostname of your IDP). Step 3, fire up a configuration tool to perform any other last mile configuration.","title":"Minimal Configuration"},{"location":"install/#databases","text":"Gluu Flex gives you a few options to store data: MySQL, Postgres, Couchbase, Amazon Aurora, and Spanner. You can also configure an in-memory cache server like Redis. Sometimes installation and configuration of this database is included in the setup process. Sometimes, you need to setup the database ahead of time. Please refer to the database instructions specific for your choice. And of course, you may need to refer to the database documentation itself--we don't want to duplicate any of that third party content.","title":"Databases"},{"location":"install/#optimization","text":"Remember, installation is just a starting point.

Pushed Authorization Requests-PAR: # PAR are handled by an additional endpoint of Authorization Server (AS).

This request URI value is used as a reference to the authorization request payload data in a subsequent call to the authorization endpoint. We can set different PAR lifetimes for different clients . PAR lifetime will be 600 seconds if it is unspecified . We have two new configuration properties for PAR: * parEndpoint - String , corresponds to pushed_authorization_request_endpoint as defined by specification . * requirePar - Boolean parameter indicating whether the only means of initiating an authorization request the client is allowed to use is a pushed authorization request .
