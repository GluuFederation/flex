## Welcome to the Gluu Flex Project

Gluu Flex is a commercial distribution of the Linux Foundation Janssen Project. 
It was created for businesses who want the protections of a commercial license, 
plus some additional tools convenient for enterprise scale. 
Flex is built from Janssen Project components,  so migrating to or from the 
open source distribution is easyâ€“just update your configuration.

## User Interface for Administration

Gluu Flex provides user interface to perform complex administration tasks 
and to manage configuration. This administration UI provides enterprise IAM 
administrators with features like MAU monitoring, session monitoring, 
managing user attributes and much more. While the section below provides a
quick glimpse of what administration UI can do for administrators, for a 
complete deep-dive of all the features, head over to the 
[documentation](https://docs.gluu.org/v5.0.0-20/admin/admin-ui/introduction/).

### Take Control
